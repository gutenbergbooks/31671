<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr/>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">For</span> many years I have wished that some able
pen would place before the community at
large the knowledge contained in the following
pages. Some of this information has appeared
from time to time in such books as &ldquo;Graham's
Lectures on Chastity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Todd's Students' Manual,&rdquo;
and a few popular works of a similar kind, which
have been of immense service to the human race
in preserving chastity and in reclaiming the unchaste.
But all these are now inadequate to the
growing demand for more light on these vital
topics. It has been too much the custom for
everyone, parents included, to shrink from instructing
their own children, or those entrusted to
their care, on these points; consequently, many
young people <em>solely from their ignorance</em> fall into
the direst evils of a sexual nature and are thereby
much injured and sometimes wholly ruined for
life's important duties.</p>

<p>An experience of forty years in my professional
career has afforded me thousands of opportunities
for sympathizing with young men, and young
women too, who had unconsciously sunk into these
very evils merely for want of an able writer to place
this whole subject truthfully and squarely before
them, or for some wise friend to perform the same
kind office verbally. The perusal of a work by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>Wm. Acton, M.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;S., of London, on &ldquo;The
Functions and Disorders of the Reproductive
Organs in Childhood, Youth, Adult Age, and Advanced
Life,&rdquo; has, by his purity of sentiments,
which have ever been identical with my own, both
inspired and emboldened me to write a work of
similar import. But his is for the profession while
mine is for the profession and the laity, of both
sexes and of any age. May its perusal inspire the
readers with a higher appreciation of the matters
herein treated, and with a greater effort to reformatory
measures everywhere. Whenever I
advise the consulting of a &ldquo;judicious&rdquo; (a term I
use many times) physician, I mean one fully and
practically qualified, both by inherent qualities
and <ins title="education">education,</ins> for the fullest confidence of his
patients.</p>

<p>I am indebted to my son, Joseph&nbsp;C. Guernsey,
M.&nbsp;D., for assistance in editing and carrying this
work through the press.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br/><br/>
<small>Introductory.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">In</span> the creation of the world and all that
therein is, we should consider it an axiom
that &ldquo;Everything was created for use.&rdquo; All
individual substances, or beings, that come to
our notice bear certain relations to one
another, have connection one with another,
and are dependent upon and useful to each
other; and nothing could possibly exist or
subsist without this co-relation: connection
with and use to each other. This is a law
which needs only a little reflection to be accepted
as a truth in every particular&mdash;in the
greatest as well as in the least created form.
This is more plainly seen in the animal kingdom
than in the mineral or vegetable, because
its members associate and finally become
conjoined in pairs. Man and woman, who
represent the crown and glory of all created
beings, in whom are embodied all the lower
orders, were and are still created to associate
in pairs&mdash;each created for the other, the one
to help the other; the two to love and to belong
to one another. This principle, fully carried out,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>justifies and shows the necessity for the creation
of man and woman precisely as they are,
having bodies, parts and passions, will and
understanding. It is my intention in the following
pages to explain the relations existing
between the sexes, for the purpose of showing
that the greatest happiness to the human race
will be found in living a life in full accord
with these relations. In order that the subject
may be fully understood, let us examine
the physical development of man and woman
in detail, particularizing the different organs
of the body as they appear in their order
of formation, from the very inmost or beginning,
to the ultimate or end, in their respective
natures.</p>

<p>Ever since the primal creation of man and
woman, the human race has been perpetuated
by a series of births. Children have been
conceived in harmony with the natural order
of events, in such matters, and have been born
boys and girls. A boy is a boy to all intents
and purposes from his very conception, from
the very earliest moment of his being; begotten
by his father he is a boy in embryo
within the ovule of his mother. The converse
is true of the opposite sex. At this very
early age of reproduction the embryo has all
the elements of the future man or woman,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>mentally and physically, even before any form
becomes apparent; and so small is the human
being at the earliest stage of its existence
that no material change is observable between
the ovule that contains the product of conception
and a fully developed ovule unimpregnated.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>It is about twelve days after conception before
the impregnated ovule, which undergoes
many changes during this time, makes its escape
from the ovary where it became impregnated
and enters one of the Fallopian tubes,
thence gradually descending into the cavity
of the womb. Here it begins to mature and become
fitted for its birth into the outer world.
Soon now the embryo (for such it is called at
this early stage) begins to assume form. The
first indication of formation that it is possible
to discover, even by the help of the microscope,
consists of an oblong figure, obtuse at one extremity,
swollen in the middle, blunt-pointed
at the other extremity. The rudimentary
embryo is slightly curved forward, is of a
grayish white color, of a gelatinous consistence,
from two to four lines long and weighs
one or two grains. A slight depression representing
the neck, enables us to distinguish
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>the head; the body is marked by a swollen
centre, but there are as yet no traces of the
extremities. So much can be observed about
the end of the third week after conception.</p>

<p>At about the <em>fifth week</em> the embryo presents
more distinctions. The head is very
large in proportion to the rest of the body,
the eyes are represented by two black spots,
and the upper extremities by small protuberances
on the sides of the trunk. The embryo
at this stage is nearly two-thirds of an inch in
length and weighs about fifteen grains. The
lower extremities now begin to appear in the
shape of two minute rounded tubercles. Till
about this time a straight artery has been observed
to beat with the regularity of the
pulse; but now it appears doubled somewhat
into the shape of an adult heart, although as
yet it has but one auricle and one ventricle.
As time advances we find the perfect heart
with its two ventricles and two auricles, all
developed from the original straight artery.
At this period the lungs appear to exist in
five or six different lobes and we can barely
distinguish the bronchial tubes; about the
same time the ears and face are distinctly
outlined, and after awhile the nose is also
faintly and imperfectly perceived.</p>

<p>At about the <em>seventh week</em> a little bony deposit
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>is found in the lower jaw. The kidneys
now begin to be formed, and a little later the
genital organs. The embryo averages one
inch in length.</p>

<p>At <em>two months</em> the rudiments of the extremities
become more prominent. The forearm
and hand can be distinguished but not the
arm above the elbow; the hand is larger than
the forearm, but is not supplied with fingers.
The sex cannot yet be determined. The
length of the embryo is from one inch and a
half to two inches, and it weighs from three
to five drachms. The eyes are discernible,
but still uncovered by the rudimentary lids.
The nose forms an obtuse eminence, the nostrils
are rounded and separated, the mouth is
gaping and the epidermis can be distinguished
from the true skin.</p>

<p>At <em>ten weeks</em> the embryo is from one and a
half to two and a half inches long, and its
weight is from one ounce to an ounce and a
half, the eyelids are more developed and descend
in front of the eyes; the mouth begins
to be closed by the development of the
lips. The walls of the chest are more completely
formed, so that it is no longer possible
to see the movements of the heart. The fingers
become distinct and the toes appear as
small projections webbed together like a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>frog's foot. At about this period the sexual
organs show their development as follows:
On each side of the urinary locality an oblong
fold becomes distinguishable; in course of
progress if these folds remain separate, a little
tubercle forms in the anterior commissure
which becomes the clitoris; the nymphæ develop,
the urethra forms between them, and
the female sex is determined. If, on the other
hand, these folds unite into a rounded projection
the scrotum is formed, the little tubercle
above becomes the penis and hence the male
sex. The testicles forming within the body,
descend later into the scrotum, and organs
similar to them, their counterparts, form in the
female and are called ovaries. These ovaries
are found attached to an organ called the
womb, and this again is united with the vagina,
which leads downwards and outwards
between the labia majora.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>At the end of the <em>third month</em> the weight
of the embryo is from three to four ounces
and its length from four to five inches, the
eyeballs are seen through the lids, the pupils
of the eyes are discernible, the forehead, nose
and lips can be clearly distinguished. The
finger nails resemble thin membranous plates,
the skin shows more firmness, but is still rosy-hued,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>thin and transparent. The sex can now
be fully determined.</p>

<p>At the end of the <em>fourth month</em> the product
of conception is no longer called an embryo,
but a f&oelig;tus. The body is from six to eight
inches in length and weighs six or seven
ounces. A few little white hairs are seen
scattered over the scalp. The development
of the face is still imperfect. The eyes are
now closed by their lids, the nostrils are well-formed,
the mouth is shut in by the lips and
the sex is still more sharply defined. The
tongue may be observed far back in the
mouth, and the lower part of the face is
rounded off by what a little later will be a
well-formed chin. The movements of the
f&oelig;tus are by this time plainly felt by the
mother, and if born at this time it may live
several months.</p>

<p>At the end of the <em>fifth month</em> the body of
the f&oelig;tus is from seven to nine inches long
and weighs from eight to eleven ounces. The
skin has a fairer appearance and more consistence;
the eyes can no longer be distinguished
through the lids, owing to the increased
thickness of the latter. The head,
heart and kidneys are large and well developed.
At the end of the <em>sixth month</em> the
f&oelig;tus is from eleven to twelve and a half
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>inches in length, and weighs about sixteen
ounces, more or less. The hair upon the
scalp is thicker and longer, the eyes remain
closed, and very delicate hairs may be seen
upon the margins of the eye-lids and upon
the eye-brows. The nails are solid, the scrotum
small and empty, the surface of the skin
appears wrinkled but the dermis may be distinguished
from the epidermis. The liver is
large and red, and the gall-bladder contains
fluid.</p>

<p>At the end of the <em>seventh month</em> the length
of the f&oelig;tus is from twelve and a half to fourteen
inches, its weight is about fifty-five
ounces, and it is both well defined and well
proportioned in all its parts. The bones of
the cranium, hitherto quite flat, now appear a
little arched, and as the process of ossification
goes on, the arching increases till the vault is
quite complete. The brain presents greater
firmness, and the eye-lids are opened. The
skin is much firmer and red. The gall-bladder
contains bile.</p>

<p>At the end of the <em>eighth month</em> the f&oelig;tus
seems to thicken up rather than to increase
in length, since it is only from sixteen to
eighteen inches long while its weight increases
from four to five pounds. The skin is red,
and characterized at this period by a fine
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>downy covering, over which is spread a quantity
of thick viscous matter, called the sebaceous
coat, which has been forming since the
latter part of the fifth month. The lower jaw
has now become as long as the upper one,
and in the male the left testicle may be found
in the scrotum. Convolutions appear in the
brain structure.</p>

<p>At <em>nine months</em> the anxious time of parturition
has arrived. The f&oelig;tus is from nineteen
to twenty-three inches in length and weighs
on an average from six to eight pounds.
Children at birth sometimes weigh as much
as fourteen pounds; but such extremes are
very rare. At this period the white and grey
matter of the brain are distinct, and the convolutions
are well marked; the nails assume
a horny consistence, hair upon the head is
more or less abundant, the testes are in the
scrotum, and the entire external genital organs
of both male and female are well formed.</p>

<p>The above particulars respecting the development
of the human being have been
narrated to show that one organ is just as
important as another, and that each is really dependent
upon the other; no one could exist
without the other and all are to subserve a
use. First must be the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">esse</i> (the inmost) the
vital force imparted to the ovule. A little
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>later certain changes take place in the ovule,
later still other changes, and finally about the
fifteenth day a slight development of the new
human being can just be outlined by the help
of the microscope, which, as before stated, has
form at about the third week after conception.
First the vestige of a head and body, a little
later the heart and lungs appear lying in the
open chest; then the hands are protruded from
the sides of the trunk, afterwards the forearms,
then the arms, all pushed out from the
body; the feet and legs gradually protrude
from the lower end of the trunk, and the chest
closes up so that the heart and lungs can no
longer be seen; the face, mouth and eyes take
form, the external genital organs make their
appearance in conjunction with other developments,
and in due course of time the boy or
girl is born ready for further developments
in childhood, and adolescence. When
the latter development has been attained, if
due care has been taken by all interested
parties, we have pure men and pure women
fitted to enter upon the privileges and the
<em>uses</em> of a wedded life according to the design
of our Creator.</p>

<p>How wonderfully and how instructively are
all organs in the animal body disposed and
arranged! In the highest place we find the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>brain to govern and rule over all below. It
is the first organ formed and in an orderly
life should control all the others. Next in
order and importance are the heart and lungs,
which put into motion all other parts and enable
the animal frame to continue in motion.
So each and every organ is developed in its
proper order, all to obey the commands of
the first and most important&mdash;the brain, the
seat of the reason and the will. Happy are
they of either sex who will govern themselves
by a pure enlightened reason and a pure
affectionate will.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br/><br/>
<small>The Infant.</small><br/>
<i>Embracing the First Year of the Child's Life.</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">The</span> battle of life really begins as soon
as the child is born. Its cleanliness, its
clothing, its temperature and its food are
matters for daily observance and care, as also
are the light, sunshine and air which it is to
breathe. Opiates, soothing syrups and cordials,
are to be strictly avoided as being deleterious
to health; proper sanitary measures
usually suffice to render all <em>dosing</em> unnecessary.
Spirituous potions and lotions should
be avoided as being contrary to the laws of
hygiene as well as for fear the child may
learn to love and to become addicted to their
use later in life. Every organ of the body
should be carefully protected even at this
early age, so that health may reign supreme.
Particular care and the utmost solicitude
should be bestowed upon the genital organs.
No rubbing or handling of these parts should
be permitted under any pretense whatever&mdash;beyond
what may be absolutely necessary for
cleanliness. The genital organs require just
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>as much watchful care, if not more, as the
stomach, the eye, the ear, &amp;c. I regret to
say that I have known some fathers to tickle
the genital organs of their infant boys until a
complete erection of the little penis ensued,
which effect pleases the father as an evidence
of a robust boy. The evil effects of such a
procedure are too manifest to require dilating
upon. Fathers take warning!</p>

<p>Nurses are known to quiet young children
by gently exciting pleasurable sensations
about the genital organs both of males and
females&mdash;practices which are the most vicious
and vice-begetting that can possibly be invented.
Many a young man and young
woman has fallen to very low depths from
influences developed by these and similar
means. Nurses should be cautioned in this
matter <em>and carefully watched too</em>, as even the
least suspected may (innocently perhaps) be
guilty of this fault to save themselves the
trouble of quieting their charges in a proper
way. Early impressions upon these animal
passions, as well as those made upon other
senses of the young, are very abiding. Mothers
be watchful!</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the
choice of a diaper for infants and the material
of which it is made. The diaper should fit
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>easily about the organs which it covers and
protects, so as not to cause undue heating or
friction of the parts; and immediately after a
babe has soiled itself either with urine or
from a motion of the bowels, it should be
made clean and dry at once to avoid any irritation
that would otherwise ensue upon these
delicate parts. The material of which the
diaper is made should not be stiff or harsh,
but very limp, soft and pliable; nor should it
be thick and bungling. There are great objections
to the use of oil-cloth, rubber or other
impervious materials as they prevent the escape
of perspiration, urine, fecal matter, etc.
As soon as possible, say near the end of the
first year, the child should be taught to use
its little chair-commode, thus dispensing with
the diaper at an early age. This is much
better for the sexual organs, is more comfortable
for the child and is more healthy; it also
favors a more perfect development of the
limbs and joints, the hip joints particularly.</p>



<div>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br/><br/>
<small>Childhood.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">Childhood</span> is that portion of life extending
from infancy to adolescence,
which in boys occurs at the age of fourteen
to sixteen years; and in girls at the age
of twelve to fourteen years. In very warm
climates adolescence is reached some two
or three years earlier.</p>

<p>Most fortunate the infant who has completed
its term of life, thus far, in accordance with the
strictest rules of Hygiene, or the laws of health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a state of health sexual impressions
should never affect a child's mind or body.
All its vital energy should be employed in
constructing the growing frame, in storing up
proper external impressions and in educating
the brain to receive them.&rdquo; Unfortunately
this state of health is not always attained.
Impressions may be exhibited in these organs
at a very early age either from inheritance,
from improper handling or from some morbid
condition of the child that could show
itself in no other organ of the body and
which, like morbid conditions in general,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>make their appearance somewhere in the
mind or body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sexual Precocity.</span>&mdash;Many parents who
are most particular in all other respects, as to
the moral and physical training of their children,
imagine there is no need to pay any
special attention to the genital organs. This,
however, is a grave mistake and needs our
careful consideration. As is well known,
some children evince a sexual precocity
which may lead to very serious results. In
these it often happens that the sexual instinct
arises long before puberty; such children, if
males, manifest an instinctive attraction
towards the female sex which they show by
constantly spying after their nurses, chambermaids,
etc.; by seeking as much as possible to
play with children of the opposite sex and
improperly toying with them.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>&ldquo;One case is
so remarkable that an abstract of it may be
instructive: M.&nbsp;D&mdash;&mdash;, between five and six
years of age, was one day in summer in the
room of a dressmaker who lived in the family;
this girl thinking that she might put herself
at ease before such a child, threw herself on
her bed, almost without clothing. The little
D&mdash;&mdash; had followed all her motions and regarded
her figure with a greedy eye. He
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>approached her on the bed, as if to sleep, but
soon became so bold in his behavior that the
girl, after having laughed at him for some
time was obliged to put him out of the room.
This girl's simple imprudence produced such
an impression on the child that forty years
afterwards he had not forgotten a single circumstance
connected with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Parents are remarkably careless on this
point. They allow children to play together
for hours at a time without the surveillance
of an older person, provided only they are
removed from any danger. It is sufficient to
merely draw attention to such a custom as
every reflective mind can easily draw the inevitable
consequences. Habits are indulged
in and marks of familiarity shown which
should not for an instant be tolerated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Causes</span> which commonly produce sexual
impressions on young children are, allowing
them to repose playfully on their belly,
to slide down bannisters, to go too long without
urinating, constipation or straining at
stool, cutaneous affections, and worms. Also,
thoughtless acts of elder people which are
very frequently more closely observed than
is commonly supposed. The sliding down
bannisters produces a titillation which is
agreeable to the sexual organs. Children of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>both sexes will constantly repeat this act until
they learn to become inveterate masturbators,
even at a very early age.</p>

<p>Among boys a disease called <em>priapism</em>
is often developed; this arises from undue
handling of the parts, or from some morbid
state of the child's health. The disorder consists
of paroxysms, occurring more or less
frequently, of violent erections of the penis;
these sometimes become very painful and require
the attention of a physician. At all
events medical aid should be sought at once,
because some functional derangement is at
work which might, if not arrested and cured,
give rise to masturbation. Owing to unknown
causes such morbid conditions induce some
little boys to pull frequently at the foreskin
of the penis until their health is seriously impaired;
they pine away, lose flesh, and still
continue to worry at the foreskin, till death
has been known to result. These cases require
the most careful and skillful constitutional
treatment, until they are cured.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in other cases, the foreskin becomes
inflamed, offensive secretions may
form about the end of the penis, etc. All
such disorders should be submitted to a judicious
physician at once, to avoid irritations
which might result in a tendency to sexual
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>excitement&mdash;a calamity truly deplorable to
the young. The idea which some writers advance&mdash;that
a long prepuce (or foreskin)
often proves an exciting cause of troublesome
sensations to the boy, is certainly erroneous.
So, too, it is all wrong to state that particular
care should be taken to wash under the prepuce.
That this objection in regard to washing
is true, is proved from the physical fact
that in a large majority of boys the orifice of
the foreskin is not sufficiently opened to permit
of these washings. And the objection is
still further proved by the fact that all these
unnatural secretions, offensive odors, sensations,
etc., which irritate and worry a boy
together with all inflammations of these parts
are soon relieved and permanently cured by
the proper medicament. Needless laving,
handling or rubbing the sexual parts should be
avoided as strictly as possible. To show how
little good such washings really do, even
though persisted in, I will mention one out
of many similar cases: &ldquo;In spite of repeated
washings every day, a fetid smegma was deposited
in considerable quantity on the glans,
causing a tiresome burning and itching.&rdquo; All
such cases are utterly intractable by any
amount of bathing. But the suitable remedy
administered internally cures the trouble permanently
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>in a few weeks and at the same
time improves the general tone and health of
the individual. This is so because the proper
remedy removes the morbific cause which
produced that condition of the penis and all
concomitant symptoms, at the same time. It
must be remembered that the troubles referred
to above come from within, and that they are
but developments of internal morbific causes.
In a similar manner, small pox, measles,
chicken pox and all eruptive diseases come
<em>out</em> as products from morbific causes <em>within</em>.
No sane person ever thinks of washing off
these appearances with the hope of curing
the case!</p>

<p>All our external parts were made just as
they should be and they work in harmony so
long as we are perfectly healthy inwardly.
Every blemish upon the skin, even to a wart,
has a corresponding morbid influence within,
which can be removed by proper treatment.
Let it be remembered then for all coming
time that a little boy's penis is never to be
meddled or trifled with, nor his foreskin, nor
the parts about the generative organs. All unnatural
conditions, appearances or sensations
require prompt and proper medical aid. If
erections of his little penis occur during sleep,
or if he cannot urinate promptly on rising in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>the morning, because of an erection, let these
conditions beget an anxiety for his welfare
and at once seek a judicious physician, who
will be able to prescribe a medicament to arrest
all further development of sexual precocity&mdash;an
affliction so baneful to the young.</p>

<p>A little later in life children are liable to
ascarides or seat worms, called by some &ldquo;pin
worms.&rdquo; No applications, purgatives, &ldquo;vermifuges,&rdquo;
injections or other mechanical means
should ever be employed to remove these, as
they are of constitutional origin and should
be so treated, until perfectly cured. Removing
the worms by irritants or by mechanical
means does not remove the <em>cause</em> of their
existence or reproduction in the body. The
dyscrasia that gives rise to these worms, with
the accompanying itching and tickling, is apt
to cause a sexual excitement which may prove
more disastrous than the original trouble
itself. Therefore be sure that this affection is
treated constitutionally; so long as the vital
forces work in harmonious order, no abnormal
appearances of any kind can come to
light, because they do not exist.</p>

<p>From the age of nine to fourteen, boys
generally acquire very curious notions about
sexual affairs and are naturally, from what
they hear, desirous of obtaining some idea
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>of sexual congress, a knowledge of where
babies come from, etc. This curiosity, of
course, causes the mind to dwell much upon
sexual subjects. I fully believe that good
information will, by satisfying this curiosity,
free the mind to a great extent from sexual
thoughts. It is from such very thoughts that
boys are led to play with their sexual organs
in secret, and to handle them so as to excite
pleasurable sensations; erections of the penis
are thus produced and finally, by this continual
excitation with the hand, the <ins title="heighth">height</ins> of
sexual orgasm is reached, ejaculation of
semen occurs and <em>self-pollution</em> is the consequence.
This act is called &ldquo;masturbation&rdquo;
and becomes a <em>secret vice of the worst kind</em>!</p>

<p>Very frequently and to an alarming extent
&ldquo;masturbation&rdquo; is taught by older boys, and
by young men even, in nearly all our colleges,
boarding, public and private schools, and by
companions under the paternal roof. This
act is repeated time after time until the degrading
and destructive (morally and physically
so) habit is confirmed. As a result, the
boy grows thin, pale, morose and passionate;
then weak, indolent and indifferent; his digestion
becomes impaired, his sleep short, disturbed
and broken; he sometimes becomes
epileptic or falls into a state of marasmus; in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>any case he is in great danger of being totally
ruined forever.</p>

<p>There is a great difference in boys regarding
the formation of these habits. While
some may almost insensibly glide into them,
others, intuitively as it were, turn away from
all such temptations and banish all thoughts
of a sexual nature from their minds at once.
This is right. So long as a boy's mind refuses
to harbor such baleful approaches, so
long he is safe; but the moment he heeds
them and allows them to enter his mind, that
moment he is in danger and will most likely
fall into bad habits. He must strenuously
resist all such thoughts and going to his
father or mother tell them about his trials and
temptations and strive to forget them until
success crowns his efforts. By persistent
efforts, by repeated prayers to the Lord for
help, by reading his Bible and good, pure
stories, by running into the open air and indulging
in some useful occupation or joyous,
healthful play, he will eventually conquer
them and thus rise to the dignity of a true
man. Sometimes, too, it may be necessary
to consult the physician for help. In addition
to the instinctive shrinking which every right
minded person generally feels from putting
ideas of impurity into a child's innocent mind,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>a parent's pride leads him to hope that <em>his</em>
boy would not indulge in any such mean and
disgusting practices. But, bearing in mind
the advice of Herbert Spencer&mdash;&ldquo;that the
aim of discipline should be to produce a <em>self-governing</em>
being,&rdquo; the best advice a parent
or guardian can, and ought, to give, is: do
not harbor bad thoughts or feelings about
anything; at once turn them away and think of
something else, of something good, true and
pure. Indulge in no hatred or revengeful
feelings towards others; plot no evil things;
always be true to your word, faithful to your
duties and charitable to all. Treat everybody
kindly and politely. And further, a child
should be <em>taught</em> what &ldquo;chastity&rdquo; really is,
instead of leaving him to find it out as best
he may.</p>

<p>It should be clearly explained to him that
true chastity requires the shunning of all indecency
and foul language; that he should
refrain from touching his secret parts except
when the necessities of nature require it; that
all sexual emotions should be subjugated.
When he grows older every boy should be
taught that chastity means continence; and it
should be firmly impressed upon his mind
that all lascivious actions are a drain upon
his whole system and weaken the powers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>which the Lord has given him to be employed
<em>only</em> in the married state. These are characteristics
of a true man and will help him very
much to keep out of sexual difficulties which,
as we shall see further on, are among the
greatest curses of life.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco, wine, coffee or tea by
children is well known to be highly injurious.
Never allow a child to use either of these&mdash;not
even in small quantities. A too common
practice in many families is to allow a little
wine at dinner &ldquo;to assist digestion!&rdquo; Others
allow coffee or tea, &ldquo;because my child is so
fond of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;The after-effects of all these is to
disturb the heart, to cause nervousness and
irritability, and <em>to weaken the sexual organs
in a marked degree</em>. Tobacco particularly
has this last effect in old and young, besides
producing convulsions, a dulled intellect, etc.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>Remember where the brain is and the purposes
for which it has been given! Here
reside the knowledge and the power to govern
all below it. No matter what the stomach
craves or how strongly the appetite begs for
this or that; no matter how much one may
be tempted to steal, to lie or to swear; no
matter how much the sexual organs may lead
one to think about or handle them&mdash;here is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>the great and good brain, the home of the
will-power, which says: &ldquo;Touch not, taste
not, handle not.&rdquo; So long as these commands
are listened to and obeyed, one is safe. The
desire need not and should not control the
act&mdash;but the rational faculty can and will control,
when early taught to do so. The more
one is led by this rational faculty the easier
it becomes to follow it, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>What has been said above regarding the
danger of little boys falling into bad habits
applies with equal force to little girls. Do
not forget this. They too may have sexual
thoughts, feelings and curiosity, and care
must be taken to keep their minds pure and
bodies healthy. They are also liable to disorders
that require prompt and careful attention,
such as <ins title="inflamations">inflammations</ins>, excoriations, itchings
and swellings of the genital organs with
discharges from these parts resembling leucorrh&oelig;a.
All such conditions lead them to
more or less rub and scratch these parts&mdash;which
should never be touched&mdash;for relief.
Pleasurable sensations are experienced and
then comes masturbation&mdash;<em>a sin chargeable to
the parent</em> for not having given the matter
proper medical attention. &ldquo;Repeated washings&rdquo;
will no more cure these cases in little
girls than, as shown above, will they cure in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>little boys. All these are but the outcropping
of some constitutional affection and
should be treated accordingly. No applications
or medicated washings of any kind
should be allowed. Such external treatment
only palliates the suffering for a little while
without removing the disordered vital force that
gave origin to its appearance. This is simply
repressed and may react upon the child and
appear in another form tenfold worse than
the first. The passing of urine or fecal matter
may (in either sex) cause irritation and
excoriation; this is another sign that all is
not right in the vital forces and should be
mentioned to the physician as a sure index
that medical treatment, but not topical applications,
is absolutely necessary. All abnormal
appearances, actions and discomforts of
the child, whether mental or physical, should
be submitted to an experienced and judicious
physician. A healthy child should be happy
and comfortable in all respects.</p>

<p>A very successful plan for keeping children
from vice or vicious habits is to see that their
time is fully occupied with amusements and
duties which interest them. They need a
great deal of harmlessly conducted amusement
and&mdash;do <em>not</em> strive to &ldquo;keep them quiet.&rdquo;
Allow little boys and girls to play together,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>under proper surveillance, and let them be
boisterous if they will; let them romp and
run, climb fences, trundle hoops, jump rope,
go to dancing school, participate in military
drills, go coasting and skating, take swimming
lessons, etc.</p>

<p>No judicious parents will allow a son or
daughter to be alone much; to seek to be
alone is always a bad sign and should be
carefully guarded against without its being
known that such precaution is observed.
Furnish them liberally with instructive and
innocent story books and let them read aloud
to you or to each other. Take them to walk or
ride when you go, and strive to make companions
of them as much as possible, making whatever
sacrifices are necessary to attain this end.
Above all, <em>encourage their making confidants
of you</em>. Let them feel that they can come
and talk freely on any subject, no matter what
its nature may be. Do this, and you have
thrown around them a bulwark of defence that
will withstand the repeated attacks of hosts
of evil spirits. When night comes and they
go to bed, let them learn to go to sleep at once;
no play then&mdash;they may be read to sleep, but
no romping or playing. No strange children
should be allowed to sleep with yours; make
them occupy separate rooms or at least separate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>beds; be sure that the sleeping places
of your children are sacred to them alone.
Nor is it advisable for children to sleep with
a grown person of either sex and particularly
not with servants&mdash;all for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>The observance of all these precautions
against influences that might excite sexual
disturbance is most sacred in its character
and most needful even in a religious point of
view; for there should be <em>chastity</em> above all
things.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br/><br/>
<small class="non-smcap">ADOLESCENCE OF THE MALE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">Adolescence</span> of the male embraces
the period of life from the age of fourteen
or sixteen years to the age of
twenty-five.</p>

<p>At about the age of fourteen years &ldquo;the
period of youth is distinguished by that advance
in the evolution of the generative apparatus in
both sexes, and by that acquirement of its
power of functional activity, which constitutes
the state of <em>Puberty</em>.&rdquo; At this age the
following great changes take place in the
general appearance and deportment of the
male: His frame becomes more angular
and the masculine proportions more pronounced;
increased strength and greater
powers of endurance are manifested; the
larynx enlarges and the voice becomes lower
in pitch as well as rougher and more powerful;
new feelings and desires awaken in the
mind. His deportment becomes more commanding,
his frivolity is less and less apparent,
and the boy is lost in the man. If he has
been so fortunate as to escape all the dangers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>and baneful influences of childhood, he is
manly indeed, and we behold him with an
unburdened conscience, bright intellect, frank
address and good memory. His spirits are
buoyant and his complexion clear; every
function of his body is well performed, and
no fatigue is felt after moderate exertion. He
evinces that elasticity of body, and that happy
control of himself and his feelings, which are
indicative of the robust health and absence
of care which should accompany youth. His
time is devoted to his studies, duties and
amusements; as he feels his stature increase,
and his intellect enlarge, he gladly prepares
for his coming struggle with the world.</p>

<p>All boys may come to this condition with
proper training through the period of infancy
and childhood; and after arriving at the
adolescent age of their existence as they have
the power of mind to <em>choose</em>, so also have they
the power to <em>refuse</em>. The human race is created
above the animal so that we are something
more than mere animals; we are human
beings with human propensities, human passions,
human desires and human tastes, which
are subject to the human brain, to the human
reason and to the human will&mdash;all elevated
and ennobled by the Divine Will. Man must
not let himself down to be governed by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>animal passions; the moment he does that,
his higher powers suffer and become weakened,
and he becomes more like an inferior
animal; if he persists in this downward
course, his lower powers become strengthened
until finally they transcend and rule the
higher. Then, to all intents and purposes,
such a man's head is downwards and the
lower part of his body is upwards just where
his head ought to be.</p>

<p>Man is a human being, yet, like the whole
animal kingdom, he has appetites, desires
and passions, as it is absolutely necessary that
he should have. He has organs corresponding
to these appetites, desires and passions, and
it is necessary that he should have them. A
proper understanding in regard to this matter
will convince anyone of the truth of this
assertion. Our Creator doeth all things
wisely and well, in the most perfect manner
possible. Consequently, man with all his
organs, parts and passions is just what he
should be when he blossoms into youth, in
the perfection of his adolescence as described
above. In fact there could be no other form
of creating man, for the Lord always creates
in the most perfect way possible, according
to one harmonious law which He has ordained
to govern the creation of all beings.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>
Such a man is fully prepared to struggle
with himself and the world at large. In his
desires, appetites or passions of any kind, he,
in his humanity, protected by his rational
faculties and enlightened by the Divine
Oracle of God, unquestionably has the power
to choose between propriety and impropriety,
between the right and the wrong, between the
good and the bad. Take any evil into which
a member of the human family may fall&mdash;the
love of ardent spirit for instance; he first
thinks of it and desires to partake of some.
Finally he takes an opportunity to gratify his
desire, does satisfy it for the time and thinks
it very nice. The next craving is a little
more intense, and he cannot overcome the
temptation quite so easily as he could have
done before, and at last he indulges again.
So he goes on, step by step, until he may fall
very low. <em>The same thinking, feeling and
desiring <ins title="preceeds">precedes</ins> the adoption of every vicious
habit that was ever formed.</em> Nor will anyone
pretend to say that a persistent effort of the
will power, at the very outset, when he first
perceived the tendencies of his desires to do
what he need not do, would not have prevented
the evil; no argumentation will prevail in the
face of stubborn facts, and the real facts are
all on the side of purity and order.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
These very young men or youths, as they
progress through adolescence, may become
tempted in a variety of ways, some to the use of
ardent spirits or tobacco, others to lie, to steal,
to forge, &amp;c.; but the approach to all these
evils is gradual and first comes through the
mind. They first think about the action, turn
it over and over in their minds until they
come to greatly desire and then, later, to
commit the evil which would not have been
ultimated if the mind had been persistently
set against it in the beginning. This is an
indisputable fact.</p>

<p>In this manner many promising youths,
just as they are blossoming into the pride of
early manhood, begin to indulge in sexual
thoughts and to allow these thoughts to
influence their minds until they commit some
of the evils to which perverted and unchaste
passions lead them. If this evil be masturbation,
then they are on the direct road to ruin, as
will be seen described further on. If it be
the commission of sexual intercourse with
women, their ruin is still more certain, and in
the latter case they are exposed to one of the
worst poisons that can possibly infect the
human race. I do not overdraw the picture
when I declare that <em>millions of human beings
die annually from the effects of poison
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>contracted in this way</em>, in some form of suffering
or another; for, by insinuating its effects
into and poisoning the whole man, it complicates
various disorders and renders them
incurable. When gonorrh&oelig;a is contracted,
although frequently suppressed by local treatment
in the form of injections, it is never perfectly
cured thereby. No; the hidden poison
runs on for a life time producing strictures,
dysuria, gleet and kindred diseases; finally, in
old men, a horrible prostatitis results from
which the balance of one's life is rendered
miserable indeed. If inflammation of the lungs
supervenes, there is often a translation of the
virus to these vital organs, causing what is
termed &ldquo;plastic pneumonia,&rdquo; where one
lobule after another becomes gradually sealed
up, till nearly the whole of both lungs
becomes impervious to air, and death results
from asphyxia.</p>

<p>This horrible infection sometimes becomes
engrafted upon other acute diseases when
lingering disorders follow, causing years of
misery, and only terminating in death.</p>

<p>If real syphilis, in the form of chancre,
should be contracted, and in that form suppressed,
we have buboes often of a malignant
type, ulceration of the penis and a loss of
some portion of this member. Sometimes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>the poison attacks the throat, causing most
destructive ulcerations therein; sometimes it
seizes upon the nasal bones, resulting in their
entire destruction and an awful disfiguration
of the face; sometimes it ultimates itself in
the ulceration and destruction of other
osseous tissues in different portions of the
body. Living examples of these facts are too
frequently witnessed in the streets of any
large city. Young men marrying with the
slightest taint of this poison in the blood will
surely transmit the disease to their children.
Thousands of abortions transpire every year
from this cause alone, the poison being so
destructive as to kill the child <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utero</i>, before
it is matured for birth; and even if the child
be born alive, it is liable to break down with
the most loathsome disorders of some kind
and to die during dentition; the few that
survive this period are short lived and are
unhealthy so long as they do live. The very
first unchaste connection of a man with a
woman may be attended with a contamination
entailing upon him a life of suffering and
even death itself. There is no safety among
impure or loose women whether in private
homes or in the very best regulated houses of
ill-fame; even in Paris, where, after women have
been carefully examined and pronounced
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>free from any infecting condition, the first
man who visits one of them, often carries
away a deadly enemy in his blood, which had
lurked in concealment beyond the keen eye
of the inspector. A young man, or a man at
any age, is in far greater danger amidst
company of this stamp, than he would
be with a clear conscience and pure character
in the midst of the wildest forest,
full of all manner of poisonous serpents and
wild beasts of every description. A knowledge
of the above facts should be enough to chill the
first impulse and to make any man who
respects his own well-being, turn away and
flee from the destruction that awaits him.</p>

<p>As if the above sufferings were not a
sufficient penalty for the transgression
against the law&mdash;&ldquo;Be ye pure,&rdquo; we find yet
another. Coincident with the physical wreck,
which syphilis makes of the man who
becomes thoroughly tainted with its poison,
comes his moral wreck. He loses all respect
for the truth and all regard for his word; no
dependence of any kind can be placed upon
him, and he will not pay his debts or fulfil
any moral obligation; all because he began
by prostituting his mind more and more until,
with deadened conscience, almost literally,
his head is dependent and his feet uppermost,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>ruling all the better part of his nature. And
next come the mental sufferings&mdash;and most
agonizing they are. Unhappy to the last
degree, he no longer takes pleasure in life, but,
wishing to die, finally commits suicide. A
search in any insane asylum will show that a
very large proportion of patients are made
up from those who masturbate or have
syphilis. Stamp out these two evils, or rather
<em>curses</em> of the human race, and the supply
that feeds our insane asylums, aye and our
penitentiaries, too, will become vastly lessened.
Think of it! So many of the inhabitants of
our prisons, asylums, and our poor-houses,
are composed of men and women who have
offended against nature's laws by violating
their own sexual nature. Add to this summary
the list of broken-hearted, deflowered
virgins and unwedded mothers, and you
have the picture complete.</p>

<p>What a contrast with that manliness of
character from which he has fallen! Now he
is in an insane condition, blaming everyone
for having contributed to his many misfortunes
and his fallen condition, whereas he
alone is the culprit. No one made him
commit the first or any subsequent evil. He
allowed his own mind to yield to the first
temptation, and then went on from step to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>step, he alone being responsible for the result
Yield not the first point, and all is safe.</p>

<p>The pride of perfect adolescence, as described
a few pages back, is due to purity of
thought, to chastity and continence. This
purity shines through every tissue, enkindles
the eye with a true expression, makes
bright the countenance and erects the form.
It gives elasticity to the step, causes harmony
in the tones of the voice, and adds dignity to
the carriage and deportment. The first step
in the paths of vice in any form, whether in
sexual errors or any other, detracts in the
exact degree of the digression from all of the
above beautiful and ennobling characteristics.</p>

<p>We have spoken in the preceding pages of
new feelings and desires being awakened in
the youth after his fourteenth year. This
change is wholly due to his approaching
manhood, to the time when he will be fully
prepared to appreciate, to love and protect,
guide and support her whom he makes his
wife, and to become the father of happy and
healthy children. But this approach to manhood
is not due to the development of the
genital organs, as some writers affirm, for this
would be a reversion of orderly development.
The approaching manhood develops in full
accordance to their uses and importance <em>all</em>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>the organs belonging to man. As the well-developed
infant has all its organs developed
in a condition suitable for its state, and the
child has all its organs in all parts of the
body, developed in full accord with its state, so
adolescence follows, and every organ must
develop accordingly; and in this development
a new impetus is given to every organ
in the body. The whole man awakens to a
newness of life as is seen in the change of his
voice, the spreading out of his frame, the
independence and command of his bearing,
the activity of his brain, the soundness of his
judgment, until he becomes in the fullest
sense a rational being. Of course the development
of his genital organs keeps pace with
that of his brain; but the brain should lead
the way throughout the entire development
of the human race.</p>

<p>At the time of puberty, then, a new and a
different sensation springs up in the generative
organs, which is in perfect harmony with the
uses for which they are intended. We recognize
the use of the hands, the fingers, the
feet, the eyes, the ears, the sense of taste, &amp;c.,
and we use them accordingly. We should
think of the generative organs only in the
same light. They are intended for use, for
the highest and holiest use of procreating
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>human beings to the end that they may
become angels in heaven. These organs
were not made to be abused; but they are
abused every time the mind is allowed to
dwell upon them improperly. Every excitation
we allow from lewd thoughts or fancies,
has a debasing and deteriorating effect upon
that well-developed form, upon that conscience
so free, and upon that countenance so open
and bright, which has been described in the
preceding pages.</p>

<p>If the mere thought and excitation arising
therefrom are injurious to the perfection of the
youth, how much more injurious must be the
ultimation of that thought in masturbation, in
unlawful sexual intercourse, or in the loss of
seminal fluid by other unnatural means.</p>

<p>Right here I feel impelled to say something
of the</p>

<p class="center"><small>DIFFICULTY OF MAINTAINING CHASTITY.</small></p>

<p>I, in connection with many of our best and
wisest men who have given the subject a lifetime's
most earnest consideration, hold that
for a young man whose early education has
been carefully looked to, and consequently,
whose mind has not been debased by vile
practices, it is no more impossible mentally,
or injurious physically, to preserve his chastity
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>than to refrain from yielding to any other of
the innumerable temptations with which his
life is beset. And every year of voluntary
chastity renders the task easier by mere force
of habit. I wish to be clearly understood in
this matter.</p>

<p>So long as a young man remains chaste in
thought and deed, he will not suffer any bad
effects from his continence. It is the <em>semicontinent</em>,
the man who knows the right but
pursues the wrong, who suffers! Patients
frequently complain that enforced continence
makes them restless, irritable, unfit for
mental application of any sort, &amp;c. Sexual
intercourse is then indulged in, and presto:
for the time being, what a welcome change.
The now unclogged mind grasps with vigor
any subject presented to it, the spirits are
exuberant and the physical frame buoyant.
But, is the trouble cured, is it permanently
eradicated from the system? No! In a short
time the symptoms reappear and the same
remedy is again sought. The more the
sexual feelings are indulged the more frequent
will be their recurrence, and the result need
not be written; every candid mind can easily
see it. To their shame and confusion be it
said, there are many physicians who, when
consulted by their patients for medical assistance
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>in such trials, &ldquo;deliberately encourage
the early indulgence of the passions, on the
false and wicked ground that self-restraint is
incompatible with health. What abhorrence
can be too deep for a doctrine so destructive,
or for the teachers who thus, before the eyes
of those whose youthful ignorance, whose
sore natural temptation, rather call for the
wisest and tenderest guidance and encouragement,
put darkness for light, evil for good,
and bitter for sweet.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_E_5" href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>I declare emphatically that no symptoms
of sexual suffering, no matter how feelingly
described or cunningly insinuated, should
ever lead a physician to prescribe for a young
man that fatal remedy, illicit intercourse.
Medically as a physician, morally as a Christian,
and sympathizingly as a fellow being, I
record a solemn protest against such false
treatment. It is better for a youth to live a
continent life. The strictly chaste suffer
comparatively little sexual irritability; but the
incontinent, at recurring periods are sure to
be troubled in one or other of the ways
spoken of; and the remedy of indulgence,
if effective, requires repetition as often as the
inconvenience returns. No! When thus
consulted, let the physician prescribe the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>proper medicament, if one be necessary;
and let him direct a plain, nourishing, non-stimulating
diet, physical exertion of any
kind carried to exhaustion, and <small>SELF CONTROL</small>.</p>

<p>Would any young man in his senses listen
to a physician, who, for lowness of spirits,
mental despondency, &amp;c., should tell him to
drink plentifully of brandy or eat hasheesh?
On the same principle then let a youth shun
the physician, who, for sexual excitement,
prescribes sexual indulgence.</p>

<p>Again, such complaints coming from young
men are very often specious, and are mere
subterfuges&mdash;overdrawn pictures of their sufferings&mdash;which
are presented as an excuse for
indulging the sensual emotions, instead of
manfully and righteously struggling to overcome
them. And further, &ldquo;if anyone wishes
to really experience the acutest sexual suffering,
he can adopt no more certain method
than to be incontinent with the intention
of becoming continent again, when he has
&lsquo;sown his wild oats.&rsquo; The agony of breaking
off a habit which so rapidly entwines itself
with every fibre of the human frame (as
sexual indulgence) is such that it would not
be too much to say in the Wise Man's
words, &lsquo;<em>None</em> that go to her return again,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>neither take they hold on the paths of life.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem">
&ldquo;The sin, of all, most sure to blight&mdash;<br />
<span class="i1">The sin, of all, that the soul's light</span><br />
<span class="i3">Is soonest lost, extinguished in.&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Remember then that sexual suffering comes
to the <em>incontinent</em> man, and that it is far
easier, even for the fully developed vigorous
adult, to continue in control of these feelings,
than when they have been once excited and
indulged.</p>

<p>One single impure connection may entail a
whole life of syphilitic suffering on the unhappy
transgressor. Would this &ldquo;pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No inducement could persuade me to
assume the awful responsibilities of advising
illicit intercourse. Apart from Christian
principle, I know that there is no necessity,
physiological, pathological or any other, that
can excuse any physician for saying that the
Seventh Commandment may ever be broken.
My sentiments on the physiological side of
the question are so admirably expressed by
Acton,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> that I will here quote from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One argument in favor of incontinence
deserves special notice, as it purports to be
founded on physiology. I have been consulted
by persons who feared, or professed to fear,
that if the organs were not exercised regularly,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>they would become atrophied, or that
in some way impotence might be the result of
chastity. This is the assigned reason for
committing fornication. There exists <em>no
greater</em> error than this, or one more opposed
to physiological truth. In the first place, I
may state that I have, after many years'
experience, never seen a single instance of
atrophy of the generative organs from this
cause. I have, it is true, met with the complaint&mdash;but
in what class of cases does it
occur? It arises in all instances from the
exactly opposite cause&mdash;abuse: the organs
become worn out, and hence arises atrophy.
Physiologically considered, it is not a fact
that the power of secreting semen is annihilated
in well-formed adults leading a healthy
life and yet remaining continent. The function
goes on in the organ always, from puberty to
old age. Semen is secreted sometimes slowly,
sometimes quickly, and very frequently under
the influence of the will. No continent man
need be deterred by this apocryphal fear of
atrophy of the testes from living a chaste life.
It is a device of the unchaste&mdash;a lame excuse
for their own incontinence, unfounded on any
physiological law. The testes will take care
that their action is not interfered with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many and many a time have I heard it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>regretted and bemoaned, on account of the
many troubles they had seemed to cause,
that the sexual organs exist. It is the lewd
thoughts and uses to which they are put that
causes all this misery, and there is always
that &ldquo;first thought&rdquo; which should not be
harbored. Cast away the impure thoughts,
rise above them, and one is safe! Pure
thoughts can <em>never</em> lead to harm.</p>

<p>The generative organs, with their functions
and uses, are most closely interwoven with
the highest destiny and well being of the race
physically, mentally and spiritually; they are
a part of us, without which there would be no
men and women, lovers and loved ones,
fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters.
We must then happily accept the situation as
it is, and our bodies, parts and passions as
they are; for they are all indispensable, high
and holy, when kept in an orderly and chaste
condition. We only need the above knowledge
and its application to make ourselves as
happy in the enjoyment of these organs as it
was designed by our Creator that we should
be.</p>

<p>To rise above the sexual temptations that
may be more or less experienced by many
and perhaps by all, requires an effort of
course, and frequently a very great effort;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>but let it be borne in mind that all temptations
to do wrong, require effort to overcome them;
and as a rule, the greater the evil we are
tempted to commit the greater is the effort
needed to overcome it. Now, as shown above,
since sexual matters are so thoroughly interwoven
with the highest destinies of the human
race, physically, mentally and spiritually, there
is scarcely any function of higher import, allotted
to any individual, than that assigned to
the genital organs. No function more deeply
concerns the healthfulness of the body, the
clearness and brilliancy of the intellect, or the
purity and sincerity of the soul itself.</p>

<p>Several times in the course of this book I
have referred to the term &ldquo;abuse.&rdquo; By &ldquo;abuse,&rdquo;
I mean precisely what <i>Lallemand</i> so forcibly
expresses as follows: &ldquo;<i>I understand by the
term abuse, when applied to the organs of
generation, any irregular or premature exercise
of their functions; any application of them
which cannot have, as its result, the propagation
of the species.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Look at the habitual masturbator! See how
thin, pale and haggard he appears; how his
eyes are sunken; how long and cadaverous is his
cast of countenance; how irritable he is and how
sluggish, mentally and physically; how afraid
he is to meet the eye of his fellows; feel his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>damp and chilling hand, so characteristic of
great vital exhaustion. Taken as a class, how
terrible are their lost virility, their miserable
night's sleep, their convulsions and their
shrunken limbs. They keep by themselves,
seeking charm in solitude and are fit companions
for no one; they dare not read their
Bible, they cannot commune with good
angels nor with the Lord, our Saviour. Is
not this picture deplorable? It is at the last
end of the chain I admit, but it is reached
link after link, one at a time; and the first
link was forged when the first temptation in
the mind was first favored and finally yielded
to. The above picture is a true one and
shows how intimately connected are the soul,
the mind and the body with this whole subject.
Man in a healthy state need not and should
not lose one drop of seminal fluid by his own
hand, by nightly emissions or pollutions, or
in any way, until he becomes conjoined to a
wife of his choice in the holy bonds of matrimony.
Every time the seed of his body is
lost in a disorderly or unnatural way, he
injures the finest textures of his brain correspondingly,
as well as the finest and most exalted
condition of his mind and soul, because
the act proceeds in its incipiency from a willful
prostitution of these higher powers.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
When sexual thoughts and temptations
arise in one's mind, even very young men are
capable of putting them away, urged by the
thought that tampering with one's generative
organs is wrong. He should intuitively feel
that it is something akin to theft, or a crime
of some worse sort, for him to indulge in solitary
vice and he should intuitively feel an
inward reproach for all such meditations.
When one is sorely tempted in these matters,
as is often the case, let him reflect that he was
not created to indulge in such pleasures by
himself, and that to do so is a crime, a sin
against the God of Heaven; that it is his
destiny, his privilege and one of the uses of
his life to share such enjoyments with the
wife of his bosom; and that all excitement or
dallying with this part of his nature before
marriage only serves to weaken his sexual
powers, as well as his mind and body; also,
that it mars his sexual uses and will detract
from his sexual pleasures in the married life.
Sexual indulgence of any sort in a young
man is a loss, not only to himself but also,
prospectively, to that dear girl whom he will
some day make his wife. Such reflections will
often drive away the temptation entirely.
If they are not sufficient to do so let him read
some interesting book that shall take his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>mind away from the subject; or, that failing,
let him take exercise, vigorous exercise&mdash;pushed
to fatigue, if necessary. If these states
of temptation occur in bed at night, let him
rise and read, plunge his arm into very cold
water, or if necessary go forth into the open
air and seek relief in a rapid walk. It is
better to go to any amount of trouble and to
endure any physical discomfort, than to
sacrifice one's chastity, the loss of which can
never be replaced.</p>

<p>A young man naturally desires and expects
chastity of the strictest order in the young
woman of his choice for a wife. Who would
marry a girl, no matter how beautiful or how
many and varied her accomplishments if it
were known that she had granted her favors
to any other man? And yet, what less has <em>she</em>
a perfect right to require from a young man
who presumes to pay his addresses to her?
This consideration, too, should serve as a
restraint to any amorous desires that might
infest a man's mind. It is wonderful how
keen are the perceptions of a pure minded
young lady to detect even an approach
to licentiousness in the male. He is abhorrent
to her and his very sphere betrays
him.</p>

<p>With the facts of the preceding pages,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>contained in this chapter being known, it
does seem as if every man would keep himself
pure from all carnal associations and
use the utmost care not to prostitute his
mind, that he may approach the nuptial
altar as pure in mind and body as he would
have her who is to become the idol of his
heart.</p>

<p>Now this is all very beautiful in theory and
desirable in practice, but <em>is it practical</em>? Can
man so school himself in self denial as to
accomplish this end? Are there not real
physiological facts existing which utterly
preclude the possibility of this most desirable
result? Do not, as has been alleged by some
writers, the testicles of man secrete semen
until they become so surcharged that emission
becomes absolutely necessary, and does not
this accumulation actually produce such sexual
excitement that man feels compelled to seek
relief in some way? I answer, most unhesitatingly,
NO! The above questions are all
theories and utterly devoid of fact.</p>

<p>Would Almighty God command, &ldquo;Thou
shalt <em>not</em> commit adultery,&rdquo; and then so create
man as to compel him to break his Divine
injunction?</p>

<p>Abundance of proof is at hand to substantiate
this sweeping remark of mine, were
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>this the place to produce it. Seminal fluid is
abundantly secreted and produced only during
the height of sexual excitement in the male.
As Acton remarks: &ldquo;It is a highly organized
fluid requiring the expenditure of much vital
force in its elaboration and its expulsion.&rdquo; It
is secreted from the blood of his body and
the whole man physically, mentally and spiritually
is concerned and represented in its
product; consequently the action requires an
effort of the whole man, and, if often repeated,
the effect is very exhausting to the physical
powers, to the mind and to the brain. Let
this be another warning to remain in purity
of heart.</p>

<p>We have said in the preceding pages that
man, in a healthy state, need not lose a drop
of seminal fluid until after marriage. There
are many abnormal causes resulting in what
are called wet dreams, nightly pollutions,
spermatorrh&oelig;a, prostatic emission during
stool or urination, also diurnal emissions without
erection. These may result from over
study, from errors in diet such as use of
coffee, highly seasoned food, wines, spirituous
liquors or drugs of various kinds&mdash;though
perhaps prescribed by a physician.
When these troubles arise from constitutional
disorders, a skillful physician must be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>consulted at once. Errors in diet and the
taking of drugs causing this trouble must
of course be discontinued.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>&ldquo;Certain medicines&mdash;as
astringents, purgatives, narcotics,
stimulants and diuretics especially&mdash;may bring
on conditions from which spermatorrh&oelig;a may
arise.&rdquo; Among other causes Lallemand refers
to the use of quinine, tobacco and, particularly
<em>alcohol</em>. The trouble may also arise
from injuries and many other accidental
causes, besides masturbation and venereal excesses.</p>

<p>It is distressing to see what a complete
wreck seminal losses make of those who
were once robust and healthy young men,
and what a shock they give to the nervous
system. They become weak, pale, and
feeble in mind, while all that was manly and
vigorous has gone out of them. Now which
of the two is preferable&mdash;the pride of a virtuous
youth, or the roué exhausted and worn
out by sexual abuses? It demands great
strength to become either, but really a much
greater effort for the latter; because it requires
very great perseverance for a chaste and pure
minded man to debase himself by such practices.
It depends on the mind which is all
right before yielding the first point; therefore
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>beware and shun the first step downward.
Strengthen the moral courage and exercise
the will power so as always to be able to say,
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; to whatever temptation the conscience
tells you is wrong.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br/><br/>
<small>Adolescence of the Female.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">Adolescence</span> of the female embraces
the period of life from the age of twelve
or fourteen, to twenty-one years.</p>

<p>At about the twelfth or fourteenth year of
the girl's life a marked change comes over
her form, features and mental state. Unlike
the male, the forms which in him are angular,
become in her rounded, symmetrical and beautiful,
and the characteristic feminine proportions
are well marked; she becomes more
graceful in her movements, her voice grows
sweeter, more mellow, more powerful and
capable of registering a higher tone. New
feelings and desires are awakened in her mind.
Her deportment becomes more commanding
and less frivolous, and the girl is lost in the
woman.</p>

<p>If she has been so fortunate as to have
escaped all the dangers and baneful influences
of infantile and childhood life, she is womanly
indeed, and we behold her with an unburdened
conscience, clear intellect, artless and candid
address, good memory, buoyant spirits, a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>complexion bright, clear and, as the poet declares,
&ldquo;beautiful exceedingly.&rdquo; Every function
of her body is well performed, and no
fatigue is experienced after moderate exertion.
She evinces that elasticity of spirit and gracefulness
of body, and happy control of her
feelings which indicate healthfulness of both
mind and body. Her whole time is given up
to her studies, duties and amusements; and
as she feels her stature increase and her intellect
enlarge, she gladly prepares for her coming
struggle with the world&mdash;though in a
manner becoming to her sex. This, too, is no
fanciful sketch, but is realized in thousands
of cases every year. It is one which parents
feel proud to witness in a daughter, and one
in which the daughter takes a modest delight.
We have said that every function of her body
is well performed. The functions of the female
body, which in a state of health are perfectly
free from pain, are very numerous and, in the
four years from fourteen to eighteen, she accomplishes
an amount of physiological cell
change and growth which Nature does not
require of a boy in less than twice that number
of years. It is obvious, therefore, that a
girl upon whom Nature, for a limited period
and for a definite purpose, imposes so great a
physiological task, will not have as much
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>power left for the tasks of school as a boy, of
whom Nature requires less at the corresponding
epoch. The functions of circulation, respiration,
digestion, perspiration, nutrition and
menstruation, though involuntary, are all important,
dependent one upon another, and all
develop at the proper time. Puberty is the
proper time for the appearance of menstruation,
one of the most important and sacred of
her functions. It should not be feared,
dreaded or regarded as a nuisance; it forms
a part of herself; and she never commands
the respect and forbearance of her friends, or
even of her enemies, more than when it is known
that she is &ldquo;unwell.&rdquo; It serves in many ways
as a blessing to her, rather than an inconvenience.
Let no young girl be alarmed, as,
owing to the negligence of her parents or
guardians, many are, at the first appearance
of this flow of blood from the genital organs.
She should keep more quiet than usual, at
these times, until the flow disappears, which
it will do in a few days. In a state of health
these appearances occur every twenty-eight
days and the young lady should exercise extreme
caution at such times, in avoiding unnecessary
fatigue, exposure to cold, getting
wet, suddenly cooling off when heated, etc.
One of the reasons why so many suffer at this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>time is due to the want of proper knowledge
and care, also for the want of a proper feeling
about the matter. I have known young ladies
to be guilty of the almost incredible crime of
trying to arrest the flow by plugging up the
vagina and by resorting to other means, that
they might attend a dancing party or some
pleasure excursion. Such a procedure is sure
to be followed by the direst retribution to the
offender. Nature never allows her laws to be
so trifled with. Some experience a deep
mortification on account of this function; some
think it a very great inconvenience and a
nuisance&mdash;an obstacle to their pleasure; others
feel unhappy and vexed about it. In truth,
every woman should consider it a privilege
and should regard menstruation as it really is,
a blessing from heaven; and, when rightly
performed, a help to lend loveliness to her
character, beauty to her expression, music to
her voice, and gracefulness to her form and
movements.</p>

<p>Mothers or guardians should instruct young
girls in good time as to the expected menstrual
function and prepare their minds for its advent.
They should also be carefully instructed in
regard to the external use of water&mdash;of its
attendant danger, lest they chill themselves
sufficiently to arrest this flow, which should
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>continue uninterruptedly until the function is
complete. Too many lives have been sacrificed
by suppressing the monthly flux; external
ablutions should be plentiful, but only
sufficient, as in the case of boys, for cleanliness.
If menstruation should not become healthfully
established at the proper time of age, consult
a judicious physician who will see that any
abnormal condition, preventing such consummation,
is properly removed. &ldquo;The principal
organs of elimination, common to both sexes,
are the bowels, kidneys, lungs and skin. A
neglect of their functions is punished in each
alike. To woman is intrusted the exclusive
management of another process of elimination,
viz.: the catamenial function. This, using
the blood for its channel of operation, performs,
like the blood, double duty. It is necessary
to ovulation, and to the integrity of
every part of the reproductive apparatus; it
also serves as a means of elimination for the
blood itself. A careless management of this
function, at any period of life during its existence,
is apt to be followed by consequences
that may be serious; but a neglect of it during
the epoch of development, that is, from the
age of fourteen to eighteen or twenty, not only
produces great evil at the time of the neglect,
but leaves a large legacy of evil to the future.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>The system is then peculiarly susceptible; and
disturbances of the delicate mechanism we are
considering, induced during the catamenial
weeks of that critical age by constrained positions,
muscular effort, brain work, and all
forms of mental and physical excitement,
germinate a host of ills.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_H_8" href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>Here I must be allowed to protest most
solemnly against the use of injections into the
vagina for the so-called purpose of cleanliness.
Vaginal syringes are constructed and used
now by thousands and the sufferings of the
human race are increased thereby ten thousand
fold proportionately. The vagina, like
all organs supplied with a mucous membrane,
is self-cleansing. Water, or any other fluid
thrown into this organ, has a tendency to disorder
the mucous follicles, to dry up their
secretions and thus prevent the efflux of some
of Nature's necessities. From this cause alone
there will be a reaction upon the vaginal
walls, upon the neck of the uterus and the
uterus itself; the ovaries also become disordered;
the lungs sympathize as well as the
throat and bronchial tubes, producing hoarseness,
hacking cough and a host of troubles
following in their train. Nervous headaches
of fearful intensity are frequently produced
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>from this unnatural course of procedure.
Moreover, water thrown into the vagina, to
wash it out, day after day for a considerable
time, absolutely produces a leucorrh&oelig;a most
persistent in character. This is the confession
of young ladies to me in making inquiry as
to the origin of their trouble, and I have
found that the discharge was unknown to
some of them till after the use of these injections.
It stands to reason that such unnatural
washings should be followed by a retribution
equal to the error committed, because, as before
stated, Nature's laws cannot be perverted
without a penalty. A girl should never, under
any pretext whatever, resort to such unhallowed
means for the cure or alleviation of leucorrh&oelig;a,
ulceration, or for any disorders that affect these
parts. By so doing she is really forming a
basis for innumerable future ills. If the girl
is well, she has none of these disorders, for
they all arise from constitutional derangements.
As all must acknowledge, it is a
self-evident fact&mdash;that, <em>if a woman is well,
every part of her must be well also</em>; no one
organ can, unaided, get up a disease by itself.
In all troubles of this nature, as well as of any
other, consult a judicious physician.</p>

<p>There are objections, however, of even a
graver nature than those urged above against
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>the use of such instruments. They often
excite sensations in the parts to which they
are applied, that should remain perfectly dormant
in the unmarried state. After awhile
these sensations, increasing in frequency and
influence, serve to prostitute the mind and
the young lady may become ruined for life.
I am stating facts that can be proved by multitudes
of living witnesses to-day in cases
and confessions that have come under my
own observation. On remonstrating against
this habit, some remark, &ldquo;But it feels so nice,
doctor!&rdquo; Of course, ablutions of the <em>external</em>
organs are perfectly right and proper and should
be resorted to daily. To the reflecting mind no
more need be said about this matter. Those
who wish to live in harmony with the order
of their creation and thereby preserve the
freshness of health, will not have recourse to
such means as add new derangements to the
system.</p>

<p>To preserve feminine charms as the girl
develops into womanhood, much depends upon
her mental state. She must not allow
herself to bear malice towards anyone, must
not plot evil or attempt to &ldquo;pay off others in
their own coin,&rdquo; as it is called, or seek revenge
in any way; but she must ever cultivate a
forgiving disposition, good thoughts and good
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>feelings towards everyone. There is always
danger of meeting both rude and lewd girls,
and that too in places where least expected;
they may be found in schools of all kinds and
are occasionally met with in the houses of
one's own friends. Not very long since a
charming young lady wrote me from a neighboring
city, that while sharing a bed with
another girl, she experienced a very strange
sensation induced by the improper liberties
of her bed-fellow; and so persistent were
these troublesome sensations, although occupying
a bed by herself ever after, she thought
it proper to seek my advice. Now this was
a good and pure-minded girl who might easily
have been ruined but for her inherent love of
chastity; and so our daughters are always in
danger of being contaminated. A perfectly
pure and chaste mind, unsullied by impure
thoughts or acts, and cultivated by the exercise
of all the Christian virtues, lends enchantment
to the eye, sweetness of expression to
the face, music to the voice, and gracefulness
of carriage. Cultivation of merely external
manners will not do; they must spring from
the mind and thence they shine throughout
the whole, in every fibre and movement of the
body. Such an one is truly beloved wherever
she goes; she has a real affection for her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>father and mother, brothers and sisters; and
she is fully prepared to appreciate and love
one of the opposite sex whose purity of life
and nobleness of mind fully corresponds to
her own.</p>

<p>To retain this charm of excellence will cost
her many a trial and her temptations will be
innumerable and very great. But her perceptive
faculties are keen, and at the first suspicion
of anything wrong she must have the
moral courage to say: &ldquo;No! that is not allowable,
it is not right,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;this is impure and
its tendency is to vice.&rdquo; Whatever the temptation
may be, in thought or in deed, let no
one persuade her into wrong-doing&mdash;not even
her <em>apparently</em> best friend; for it would only
be an appearance of friendship if he tempted
to anything of a vicious nature. She will be
beset with hosts of admirers, some of them
pure and having honorable intentions; but (I
am sorry to sound the note of warning here,)
others will come with the most dishonorable
intentions possible, though with an air of sincerity,
and apparently as artless as doves.
Study all men long and carefully, keeping
them meanwhile at a respectful distance;
never allow one to sit near with his arm about
your waist or to hold your hand in his; never
allow him to kiss you&mdash;<em>the vilest of loathsome
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>diseases may be communicated by a kiss</em> viz.:
<em>syphilis</em>. Do not allow any approach or touch
beyond what is customary in the best of society
at a social gathering. Many a young lady
with an angelic form and spotless soul within,
full of the best intentions and of the purest
character, giving bright promise of a brilliant
future, has been ruined for life by trusting herself
alone with some of these apparently
wise and good, yet really vile men.</p>

<p>Young women have not, as a rule, any
sexual propensity, or amorous thoughts or
feelings. If they have been properly educated
and cared for, they are, before marriage, perfect
strangers to any such sensations; and yet
any young lady who falls, does so by her own
hand and she has no one else to blame for it.
<em>Remember</em> that the Lord, in the beginning,
never suffers temptations beyond one's strength
to overcome. If she falls ultimately, it results
from allowing an impure seed to be planted
in the mind at first, which she then nourishes
for a time and only in the end it bears its fruit.</p>

<p>As time passes, a young lady forms an acquaintance
with gentlemen, and at length she
favors the addresses of one who is particularly
agreeable to her. After this acquaintance
has ripened into love, and she has become
convinced of the purity of his heart, she enjoys
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>being with him, in sitting by his side, and is
unhappy in his absence. When betrothed,
owing to her great and pure love for him, she
takes pleasure in receiving such marks of
affection from him as are shown by a tender
father or brother, but nothing more. After
marriage, she feels that she is really his and
that he has become a part of herself&mdash;that
they are no more twain but are one flesh.
All this has transpired without her hardly
suspecting such a quality in herself as an
amorous affection. Still she more than ever
loves him, more than ever desires to be near
him until finally their union is fully and truly
consummated by the marriage act. At no
time in her life does a woman make a greater
sacrifice of her feelings than at this time, and
she does it solely for her pure and fervent
love for him. This is right and proper, and
is in accordance with the laws of order in the
creation of the two sexes in the human, animal
and vegetable kingdoms throughout the
world.</p>

<p>I wish here to have some &ldquo;Plain Talk,&rdquo;
that the true object of this book may be more
fully understood and its mission more successfully
accomplished. Unless willing to make
the above sacrifice, no woman should ever
marry; because she would not then be fulfilling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>the marriage covenant. Besides, she
would be false to her husband and this falsity
might cause his moral and physical destruction;
his health would suffer and his
manhood become dethroned, because her
conduct would utterly controvert the immutable
laws of nature. Nature's laws cannot
possibly be set aside without the infliction
of a severe penalty. The healthy young
woman will have no difficulty in preserving
her chastity intact, so long as she cultivates
that purity of mind to which she is naturally
prone. She should never allow herself
to read immoral stories or books having in
the slightest degree even, such a tendency;
theatrical plays with loose morals should
also be avoided, and light, silly novels are
very pernicious to the imaginative mind
of the young. On the other hand useful
reading stores the mind with high and
noble thoughts, whence spring good and useful
deeds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a variety of morbid
conditions to which the female is liable, so
that sexual desires arise in spite of every effort
to keep aloof from them&mdash;even though there
is not the slightest guilt in mental or bodily
transgression. These are owing to disordered
conditions of the sexual system, just as other
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>disorderly desires arise, and are often <em>inherited</em>&mdash;remember
this all parents!&mdash;or they
may be caused by some morbific influences,
as are other diseased conditions of the body.
Many a time have I had pure-minded young
ladies apply to me for medical aid in these
matters, confessing that they had impure
thoughts which they knew were wrong, but
of which they could not rid themselves. In
such cases there are physical symptoms of
some kind that incite these thoughts and feelings.
The proper medical and hygienic treatment
always restores order in such functional
derangements and the sexual disturbances of
the mind disappear. I have repeatedly cured
nymphomania by curing physical, or constitutional
symptoms. In one case which came
under my care, nymphomania appeared in a
married woman in the seventh month of her
pregnancy, and so fearfully did her mania
rage that it threw her into convulsions. Her
physical and sensational symptoms led me to
the choice of the medicine that cured her, so
that she was happily delivered of a fine,
healthy child at full term and no trace of the
disease has ever appeared since. Too often
young women err and give way to such feelings
in resorting to <em>self-abuse</em> for relief, or to
the caresses of the opposite sex, when they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>are ruined forever. It is never safe to temporize
or to tamper in this way with such sensations.
Women have heads and brains, as
well as men, and rational faculties, too. Every
digression allowed, only paves the way for
others, with less and less resistance, and more
and more ruinous results. Let a judicious
physician be consulted at once in all cases
where a morbid condition seems to excite immoral
thoughts and sensations.</p>

<p>The effects of self-abuse upon woman, is as
disastrous as masturbation upon males. A
few hours after its commission, or the next
day at furthest, she feels languid and dragged
out, sleepy, unfit for reading anything solid,
or studying, and unfit for social enjoyment
with others; she looks pale and haggard;
often she feels giddy, particularly when rising
in the morning, with many other discomforts
too numerous to mention here. And is it
true that some young ladies, the sweetest and
fairest of our race, play with one another in
an immodest and indecent way, teaching immorality
to the pure and innocent? I fear it
is, I <em>know</em> it is. Such things need not, must
not, and will not be tolerated. This little
book will go about in all classes of society
confirming and strengthening the pure in
heart in their purity and enlightening the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>ignorant who will joyfully hail the good news;
all will join hands in one popular cry against
indecencies and indulgences of an impure
nature; and the vilest man even will be taught
to fear and respect the combined world of
chaste female influence. So it must be and
eventually will be; but woman, naturally
pure and lovely woman! the greatest part of
this work must be done by you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br/><br/>
<small>Marriage.</small><br/>
<i>The Husband.</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">&ldquo;And</span> <span class="smcap">Jehovah God</span> said, It is not
good that the man should be alone;
I will make him a help meet for him.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* And <span class="smcap">Jehovah God</span> brought the
woman unto the man. And the man said,
This is now bone of my bones and flesh of
my flesh. Therefore shall a man leave his
father and his mother, and shall cleave unto
his wife: and they shall be one flesh.&rdquo;&mdash;Gen.
ii. 18, 22&ndash;24.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marriage of one man with one woman
is therefore designed in our very creation by
Him who made us. The love which brings
them together and binds them together, flows
into their minds from the Divine Love, from
the love which has operated hitherto, and
which now operates, in creating and forming
a Heaven of human beings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All young men, on arriving at the age of
twenty-five, other circumstances being favorable,
should conform to the laws of Divine
order and marry. &ldquo;Whom shall we marry?
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>Young ladies now-a-days require such an outfit
and it costs so much to support a wife in
the style she wishes to live, or has been accustomed
to, that, to say nothing of the extra expense
of children, we cannot afford to marry.&rdquo;
This is a wrong view to take, <ins title="because,">because</ins>
pomp, style and show <em>are not the true objects
of marriage</em>! The married state is a duty
and a great privilege, while its uses are of the
highest possible order physically, mentally
and spiritually. The love which brings the
two together and which should bind them together,
requires only a comfortable home of
respectable appearance. Young married people
should begin like young married people;
it is more orderly and more conducive to the
welfare and true happiness of each that, as
time passes on, they build up their fortunes
together, each helping the other&mdash;thus affording
new charms that no other course will or
can yield.</p>

<p>In the choice of a wife, a man should especially
seek <em>congeniality</em>. He should make
the acquaintance of a young lady living and
moving in the same sphere of life as his own,
such as is congenial to his tastes; he should
see her in company with other young people
and observe how she treats them; and particularly
notice how she acts towards her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>father and mother, brothers and sisters: for a
good daughter and sister always makes a
good wife. Study closely her character, her
mental discipline, her tastes in reading and
her mode of life generally. Above all, note
her disposition as to selfishness, whether she
be determined and bent upon having her own
way in everything, or whether she is yielding
and thoughtful of the comfort and happiness
of her associates. Remember that in the
married state there must be a mutual yielding
to each other, though not the sinking of the
wife's identity, so that the combined life of the
two may become one harmonious whole.
Observe what she thinks of children and get
her opinion as to how they should be brought
up and educated. Be sure that she is one
who can be loved most tenderly, one for
whom a man can make any sacrifice in reason
for her sake&mdash;for whom one can deny himself
any comfort, any and every passion, brave any
danger, and conquer every difficulty in his
power, to make her life happy and useful.
One quality: Is she strictly virtuous? Is she
chastity itself in thought, word and deed?
If you, young man, have been the same,
if you have held yourself in by &ldquo;bit and bridle,&rdquo;
as it were,&mdash;then, if she reciprocates your love,
you are at liberty to propose marriage to her.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
Before marriage, a young man takes great
pains to make himself attractive, is very attentive
and polite, keeps up a genteel appearance
and is civility itself, that he may woo
and win the young lady most nearly approaching
his ideal of feminine perfection, and the
one most nearly suited to his tastes and congeniality.
After marriage he feels that she is
his, that she has pledged herself to this effect;
and the law has so decided; she is his, as he
is hers, irrevocably. Now, young man, do
you mean to be loyal, to be her real husband
until death dissolves the allegiance? Then
let nothing cool your ardor. Be as watchful
as when you were her wooer and even more
so. Let nothing induce you to swerve from
your duty, to violate your vow or to betray
your trust. But ever be faithful and true.
So may you be accounted worthy of her choice
as a husband and worthy to be enrolled
among the respected and honored fathers
in our land. Heavier responsibilities rest
upon you now than before marriage. Your
wife must be protected, supported and cared
for in every possible way, and you need
to be even more careful to retain her love
than you were to win it. You are under
heavy responsibilities to your relatives and
the community in which you live, that your
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>united lives bear such fruit as will be to all a
delight. Together, in your unity, you form
as it were a tree; your united lives throw
out branches and leaves, buds and blossoms,
and finally fruit in its season; and every tree
is known by its fruit. Bearing in mind the
high duties to which as a husband and a
father you are called, seek not to live for carnal
pleasures. You have struggled manfully
with yourself and the world and have come
up to this stage of your life pure and uncontaminated;
and that love which brought you
two together, now flows into your united lives
from the Divine Love. Let that love continually
operate through you unitedly in creating
new human beings who shall ultimately serve
to swell the grand army of the Angelic hosts
in Heaven.</p>

<p>Some well-meaning and otherwise <ins title="apparrently">apparently</ins>
good husbands, but not true, form
habits of staying from their homes during
their leisure hours, particularly in the evenings.
They visit club houses, billiard rooms
or other places of amusement, leaving their
wives at home. Such absences distress a
wife greatly, though her love often restrains
any expression of disapproval. These habits
increase, she suffers more and more, loses
sleep on his account and her health fails. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>husband's dissipations grow upon him&mdash;all
such desertions are dissipations when they
become habitual&mdash;until he loses all relish for
the company of his faithful wife and for the
caresses of his young and lovely children,
until finally to stay at home a single evening
is a restraint and unhappiness to him. Where
now is the plighted faith! Where now is the
tree, its branches and leaves with their buds
and blossoms, and what is the fruit? Where
now is that pure love which he promised when
they became united and which should forever
bind them together, and who has almost severed
that love? Has not the little that remains
become merely carnal, on his part at
least? Where is that union of mind and communion
of soul that lifts one above sensualism;
and without which, sensualism is the only
link and quality left to keep the two together,
until death dissolves the union?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br/><br/>
<small>Marriage [continued].</small><br/>
<i>The Wife.</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">Young</span> <ins title="ladies">ladies,</ins> why do you marry?
Through infancy, childhood and adolescence
you have been watched over most
tenderly and cared for most lovingly; you
have been protected and educated, and have
been made as happy under the paternal roof
as circumstances would allow; and this very
book has been written largely on <em>your</em> account.
It has been the custom from time immemorial,
as it always will be, for girls to complete their
education and then to marry. But alas! how
very few seem to realize what married life
really is and what will be expected in it; what
its duties and responsibilities are, or even what
leads to marriage. But to the question why
do you even think of getting married? The
answer is, &ldquo;Because it is inherent in the mind
of every true female character. It was ordained
of God in her creation, spiritually,
mentally, and physically&mdash;from her inmost
being to her complete ultimation. It was in
the very design of her creation that she
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>should love and be loved, that she should be
sought after by the male sex, and that she
should become a wife and mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>First, let us understand what &ldquo;marriage&rdquo;
signifies. The word itself has the same meaning
as the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conjugium</i> and represents
a conjunction or union together. Carried
out to its higher or more interior meaning,
marriage signifies the joining of good
and truth&mdash;the &ldquo;good&rdquo; being represented by
the woman and &ldquo;truth&rdquo; being represented
by the man. Hence it denotes the spiritual
conjunction of minds, and thence of bodies,
in contradistinction to the merely natural
conjunction or joining together of bodies only.
So, to secure a real marriage, there must be
a spiritual conjunction of minds; and the conjunction
of bodies in wedlock is simply the
ultimation, or manifestation of spiritual principles
in marriage.</p>

<p>The true reason why girls marry is because
they have an innate principle of love for the
male sex; and this love is drawn from the
Lord above. Consequently, it is pure, chaste,
and when fully developed, very powerful. In
connection with this principle comes the desire
to be sought after and loved by a man
of congenial character for whose dear sake a
woman is induced to leave father and mother,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>brothers and sisters, to become the wife of
him whom she can claim as her own dear
husband. This Heaven-born principle is
what leads and induces the female to assent
to the marriage relation. For her own sake,
for his sake as well as for the sake of all parties
concerned, this step should be taken very
carefully and only after mature consideration.
Once married, there is no escape from its lifelong
duties and responsibilities. She must
yield to him whatever the marriage vow allows,
that she may become a <em>wife</em> in the
fullest sense of the term. Marriage is a
sacred relation, instituted by God Himself,
and the sexual approach which follows
between husband and wife, is a special
avowal of their relation to each other; and so
often as it is repeated it is a renewal of their
obligations to be faithful to each other. All
sexuality is in the order of creation and, coming
from the Lord, serves for high and holy
purposes. It was <em>never</em> intended for mere
carnal pleasure; as such, it is the profanation
and perversion of a great boon to the human
race. The man or woman who perverts it
must and will, sooner or later, suffer a penalty
equal to the transgression.</p>

<p>The husband rightfully expects to find in
his wife, as a seal of the marriage covenant,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>his greatest possible delight. It should be
her greatest delight to give him that pleasure;
and if she loves her husband according to her
avowal, she will not fail to do this. The feeling,
each of the other's nearness&mdash;in thought,
word and act, as though each one were intertwined
with the other in the most complete
union, is a very great delight; even indescribably
great. The sexual act itself is really a
type of the perfect harmony in which the
married pair should dwell throughout their
lives. It teaches a mutual yielding so that
the honeymoon, rising so beautifully and lovingly,
may continue to wax lighter and brighter
and its fullness be attained in this world only
at the dissolution, by a natural death, of a
union so orderly and happily formed. It
is in the very nature of the male to seek
his mate; it is an inborn principle for him to
do so, and his health, even his life, certainly
his moral life, often depends upon an orderly
and lawful indulgence of what this inherent
principle demands. The greatest longevity
and the best health are found among fathers
and mothers; thereby proving that orderly
and well-regulated sexual intercourse is just
as necessary to the married couple as are the
functional demands of all other organs of the
body. From the foregoing it may be plainly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>inferred, that, if the wife of a chaste young
man who has duly guarded himself from
his childhood up, until he has sought and
wedded his mate, fails to reciprocate cheerfully
and pleasantly in the seal of connubial
affection, she proves a bitter disappointment
to him. Not that he is carnal, gross or beastly,
no! The principle given him by his Creator
and residing in his pure and inmost soul has
been violated by her in whom he placed his
life's confidence; she has proved <em>false</em> to
him in this particular, one upon which their
present and eternal welfare so largely depends.
Young ladies about to marry should be taught
to understand this matter most fully, in all
its bearings. If they pervert marriage in
false practices, the love of God, conjugal love,
and the love of infants, the three holiest and
noblest inspirations of life, perish together. No
woman then should ever marry without a full
knowledge of her duties to her husband, particularly
in the sexual respect; for without
granting this privilege to her husband in full
and free accord, there <em>cannot</em> be maintained
a happy married life.</p>

<p><em>The duties of marriage</em>, as a topic, embrace
a vast field of thought; and there is <em>so much</em>
to say thereon, so much advice to tender, so
many absolute commands to enjoin, so many
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>warnings to utter, that it is with difficulty I
restrain myself from launching out diffusely in
an attempt to give the most important of
these. But to so specifically particularize is
not the purpose of this book. Enough is said
herein, I trust, to set the reflective mind to
thinking seriously on these matters and thereby
to awaken the conscience to a full sense of its
duties. Quite too many cases have come under
my observation where the marriage vow has
never been consummated or, if consummated at
all, in a very begrudging manner, owing to the
insubordination of the wife. Consequently
dissatisfaction, unhappiness and frequently a
permanent separation follows, bringing disgrace
upon the family and scandal to their
circle of friends. This is not only wrong, but
it is a most unpardonable vice. Sexuality
has been ordained by God in his wisdom as
the means of creation. It exists throughout
all nature, in every tree, plant and shrub, in
every animal and insect; in every bird that
flies, in every fish that swims, in every man
and woman. The very best and purest of
husbands and wives, all the world over, indulge
in sexuality to their united satisfaction,
in full acknowledgment that it is of God and
from God. Every wife who is unreasonable
or derelict in this <em>duty</em> is untrue to her husband
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>and commits a sin against the God of
Heaven and earth. Since, then, sexuality is
so evidently of Divine appointment, it should
be committed entirely to him in its effects.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<p>If at any time the act prove fruitful and a
child be born, it should be considered as a
great blessing and gift from God Himself.
What is more beautiful than to see a married
couple engaged in rearing a new human being
destined to become an angel in Heaven!
For this indeed is the prime object of sexuality
and of the marriage covenant. As has been
well said, life on earth is Heaven's seminary.
And yet, so many wives, to their shame be it
said, use preventives to conception, thus attempting
to controvert the order of Nature
and Nature's God; this is one of the greatest
crimes of the present age and vengeance will
surely be taken on every transgressor in this
sacred matter. Such practice is secret vice
which little by little wears upon the inmost
vital principle until the perpetrators of such
wrongs suffer untold misery in their physical
nature&mdash;often not even suspecting the cause
of such sufferings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there is yet another reason, and a
very strong moral one, why the wife should
not remain childless. There can be no question
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>that the blood of the father mingles with
that of the mother through the medium of
the child <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utero</i>. (Hence the transmission
of blood-diseases from husband to wife.)
Hence the indelible impressions made upon a
wife by the father of her offspring&mdash;impressions,
both mental and physical, which by
character or resemblance she often transmits
to her children by a second husband. Now,
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* may not this account for the
similarity of character and identity of tastes,
and, indeed, for that wonderful personal resemblance,
which sometimes develops between
husband and wife? And does not this requisite
alone fulfil the Divine interpretation of
marriage, that &lsquo;they are no more twain but
one flesh?&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_J_10" href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>After marriage a new order of life is entered
upon by the wife, and her family matters
should subordinate all other schemes and
projects of her future existence. Her main
thought and study should now be, &ldquo;How can
I best fulfil these new duties and responsibilities?
First, my dear husband! how can I be
a true help-meet to him? Here we two are
to be one, a new <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">punctum saliens</i>, and every
act of ours will bear the image of our united
lives. No matter what may happen, I will be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>true to my matrimonial vow and to my God;
for I am in His hands and my dear husband's.&rdquo;
A married life begun in this way,
with such resolutions sincerely and studiously
kept, will secure a life full of happiness and
privileges beyond the fondest hope and expectation.
When pregnancy occurs, just as
soon as the fact be suspected, the little embryo
should be regarded as already a member of
the family. Every act of each parent should
now be performed in some degree with
reference to the forth-coming infant. The
mother's thoughts particularly should be directed
to it as much as possible whilst performing
the uses of life. She should read
much that is elevating and ennobling in character
as this serves a good purpose in producing
a more perfect, more healthy and more
brilliant child. Let her read such books as
&ldquo;Elements of Character&rdquo; by Miss Chandler;
&ldquo;Growth of the Mind&rdquo; by S. Reed; &ldquo;Sex in
Education&rdquo; by E.&nbsp;H. Clarke, M.&nbsp;D.; also,
&ldquo;Wear and Tear&rdquo; by S.&nbsp;Weir Mitchell, M.&nbsp;D.;
and any other books of like character. Do
not forget that the education of the child begins
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in utero</i>.</p>

<p>During gestation the mother should subsist
as far as possible upon fruit, vegetables and a
farinaceous diet&mdash;always plain and without
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>spices. Plenty of active exercise is indispensable
and the use of a &ldquo;Health Lift&rdquo; will be
found most beneficial. When the nine months
are completed, under care of a competent
physician, the birth of the child will be accomplished
with but comparatively little pain, and
its attendant dangers and difficulties will be
greatly lessened.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br/><br/>
<small>Marriage [concluded].</small><br/>
<i>Husband and Wife.</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">To</span> preserve the marriage vow inviolate,
the same pure love that brought the
two together should be cultivated by
home uses and home amusements such as
readings, games, conversation, etc. If the
wife have needle work, let the husband read
or talk to her; if he be a literary man, let her
presence cheer him on and inspire him to
nobler and more refined productions. What
was done during courtship that made time
pass so rapidly and so pleasantly? Was
every topic so discussed and used up that
nothing is now left for an exchange of views?
Is carnal pleasure to be the only binding tie?
Such a life is not very pure and only a poor
use can be made of it. Topics of interest to
a married pair should be innumerable and
their pleasures inexhaustible. Home is the
soil in which the tree is to grow; and the
richer the soil, the better for the tree, and the
more numerous will be the branches, all of
them vigorously developing buds and leaves,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>blossoms and fruit, which will be most fragrant,
beautiful and useful. When amusement
outside of home is sought let it be, as far as possible,
of a nature that both may enjoy it equally.</p>

<p>Husband and Wife! He, being of larger
mould in every particular, in head, chest,
and all the vital organs, is the provider, the
protector, the guardian of his home; he, the
masculine, or representative of the Truth, is
to lead the way in conducting home or
business affairs. She, the feminine, or representative
of the Good, inclines to the good
way continually; and, as married partners,
Good and Truth should be married in
them. There cannot be a true evil way
nor a good false way; there can only be
a true good way and a good true way.
So the wife, the good, must conjoin herself
to her husband, the truth, in order that
every truth may result in good; and the
husband, the truth, should seek to be conjoined
to the wife, the good, that every good
may become true. In this there is much wisdom:
if the husband be truly wise he will
always be sure that all his projects are tempered
with good; while if the wife be truly
good, all her doings will be enlightened by
truth. As hand in hand they thus go through
life's planning and doing, the husband will
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>always be assisted by his good, the wife; and
the wife will be led on in good by her truth,
the husband. By taking this high and holy
ground, there will be experienced pleasure
and happiness by the married couple, far
transcending all other modes of life in existence.
Then will each and every organ in the
body be seen to have a fitness, a place, and a
use which could not possibly be dispensed
with, because, each and all these organs have
an originating cause in the mental and spiritual
parts of mankind, from which they proceed
and from which they exist. Thus we
see how wrong, how frightfully wrong it is to
abuse, or pervert the use of, <em>any</em> of these
physical organs which are so sacred and so
important to the welfare of the human family.
&ldquo;Dishonor the body, the temple of the soul,
and you dishonor the soul.&rdquo; &ldquo;If any man
defile the temple of God, him will God destroy.&rdquo;&mdash;I. Cor. 3:17.</p>

<p>When married, the battle for one united
and harmonious life really begins. The wife's
great and supreme love for her husband personally,
will allow many privileges which
under other circumstances her timidity and
chastity would refuse. Tenderly and with
great consideration should these privileges be
accepted. For, contrary to the opinion of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>many men, there is no sexual passion on the
part of the bride that induces her to grant
such liberties. Then how exquisitely gentle
and how forbearing should be the bridegroom's
deportment on such occasions!
Sometimes such a shock is administered to
her sensibilities that she does not recover
from it for years; and in consequence of this
shock, rudely or thoughtlessly administered,
she forms a deeply rooted antipathy against
the very act which is the bond and seal of a
truly happy married life. These sexual unions
serve to bring the married pair into a perfectly
harmonious relation to each other. And just
as tenderly, lovingly and harmoniously should
they join in each and all the daily uses of life
which they are called upon to perform. The
sexual relation is among the most important
uses of married life; it vivifies the affections
for each other, as nothing else in this world
can, and is a powerful reminder of their mutual
obligations to one another and to the
community in which they live. Indulgence,
however, should not be too frequent, lest it
debilitate the pair and undermine their health.
The bridegroom and husband should carefully
watch over his bride and wife to see that she
is not a sufferer and should govern himself
accordingly. It is better that these renewed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>obligations should be made at stated periods,
as man is governed so much by habit. As a
rule, once or twice a week, or in some cases
once in two weeks, is sufficient; but once a
week will suffice in many cases for healthful
purposes. During the menstrual flow there
should be an entire cessation of the conjugal
act. When pregnancy occurs it is in most
cases, more healthful and better for the expectant
mother to allow intercourse at regular
times, very gently, throughout her gestation.</p>

<p>The object of marriage is the ultimation of
that love which brings the two together and
binds them together, in the procreation and
rearing of children for Heaven. This is the
only true aim and sole object about which
every earthly desire, interest and plan of the
married pair should cluster.</p>

<p><em>As to the question of child-bearing.</em> No
greater crime in the sight of Heaven exists
to-day than that of perverting the natural
uses of marriage. This is done in a great
variety of ways, every one of which is criminal,
in whatever form practised; and none
will escape the penalty&mdash;no, not one. Nature's
laws are inexorable; every transgression
thereof is surely punished, even at the
<em>climacteric period</em>, if not before. The questions
of failing health, of physical inability, or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>too frequent conceptions are matters for the
investigation, advice and decision of an experienced,
judicious and upright physician.
They should never be taken in hand and
judged upon by the parties themselves. And
to the objection &ldquo;can't afford to have children;
they cost too much,&rdquo; I have faith enough to
reply, &ldquo;Our Heavenly Father never sends
more mouths than he can feed.&rdquo; Let each
one do his and her duty in life and this cavil
falls to the ground like water&mdash;which, when
spilled, cannot be gathered up.</p>

<p>Good people everywhere rejoice when they
behold a married couple living together in an
orderly manner and rearing a large family of
children. How often is Queen Victoria held
up as a pattern of excellence in this respect:
she accepted and acknowledged Prince Albert
as her husband and gave herself to him as his
wife; and so indeed she was in every sense
of the term. Although a Queen, sitting on
the pinnacle of power, she did not seek to
avoid the pangs, the dangers or inconveniences
of child-bearing. By her own personal
strength her twelve children were brought
forth and her own sensitive fibres and tissues
felt the suffering. She nursed, caressed and
loved them like a good mother and she was
a <em>royal mother</em>! Other kings and queens
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>have done likewise; other husbands and
wives, high in power, wealth and fashion have
done and are still doing the same. And how
much the less should we, in the humbler walks
of life, obey the Divine command &ldquo;Be fruitful
and multiply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If a husband truly loves his wife and if she
truly loves him, they will live for each other
and in each other, and they will be one; and
they will seek to do right in every particular
of their marital relation. To apply to life
the truths advanced above and to realize
them, will require great effort by the parties
in question. This manner of life will not
come of itself; it is too good to come
without working for. Mutual concessions
must be made daily, and several times a
day; one's own way must frequently be
given up, and always when discovered to be
a selfish way, because the mutual good is always
to be consulted. Questions of importance
should be discussed freely and dispassionately,
and a good reason be established
before adopting actions that may not lead to
proper results. In the marriage co-partnership
the interest in the right and the wrong, the
loss and the gain, the lights and the shadows,
the pleasures and the pains, should be equally
shared; because they concern one just as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>much as the other, and should be equally
enjoyed, and equally borne by both.</p>

<p>A start is made with loving hearts and this
state of affairs must never be allowed to diminish.
The husband should ever be glad
to see his wife, and the wife should ever be
glad to see her husband. How many husbands
never know what reception they will
meet with on returning home after their anxious
and exhausting business hours are over
for the day; it may be a happy or a very
unhappy one. How much it consoles, encourages,
lifts up, and rests a man to return
to his home after the trying scenes of a day
busily spent in providing for the support of
his family are over, to find his wife affectionate
and serene, and all about the house brilliant
with contentment. Such a wife if she
has troubles, and of course she has just as
many troubles as the husband, though of a
different kind, and wishes to call the attention
of her husband to them, will do it at a proper
time, when she knows it will annoy him the
least, and when he will be able to give her the
most assistance. She will never try to annoy
him; but endeavoring to be a true help-meet
will seek in a proper and loving way to get
him to be the same to her. The wife will
gain and command the respect of her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>husband only through kind and loving
ways. By her love constantly and judiciously
administered she will lead him onward and
upward to higher aspirations and better circumstances
in life, throughout their days of
united existence. A scolding, fretting, worrying
and selfish wife has ruined for life many
a husband.</p>

<p>All the &ldquo;self-denial&rdquo; however, as it is called
by some, is not on the wife's side; the husband
too must be forbearing; he must remember
on his way home at night that his
faithful wife, who has been at home all day,
has had trials and disappointments in her domestic
affairs; and he must not be disappointed
to find domestic arrangements a little
disordered, and his wife somewhat chagrined
that, under the circumstances, she really could
give him no better a reception than he may
experience. He must always try to make
the best of it and be satisfied. He must not
find fault with the cooking, for instance, but
must be perfectly content with everything as
it is until his well-managing wife has had time
to overcome her difficulties and troubles.</p>

<p>Never find fault with your wife under any
circumstances; let your intellect discover a
way to better things if need be. A really
wise man will never allow a harsh word to escape
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>his lips to a loving wife, or to his harmless
children. By so living together a wise
husband and a loving wife will soon discover
that they two are but complemental to each
other&mdash;like the Will and Understanding of
one individual.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br/><br/>
<small class="non-smcap">TO THE UNFORTUNATE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">Let</span> no one imagine that, because he or she
has committed any of the great errors
enumerated in former chapters, there is
no hopeful future. Such a conclusion need not,
necessarily, be accepted. In very many cases
where there is a <em>will</em> to reform, there is also a
<em>way</em>; and very often a complete cure and restoration
to health may be effected. Diseased
bones may be made sound; ulcerations healed;
sore throats cured; blemishes on the skin removed;
urinary difficulties may be dissipated
or at least greatly ameliorated; sexual disorders
remedied; impaired eyes much improved
and defective vision much benefited if not
wholly restored; the auditory apparatus
helped if not fully cured; and the distracted
mind, with its fanciful imageries, rendered
tranquil and rational.</p>

<p>To accomplish all this the <em>mind</em> must lead
the way. The brain must assert its supremacy,
and the will-power become absolute. It
is only where there is a will, an indomitable
will, that a way out of these direful difficulties
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>is afforded. Let happen what may, no
opposing influences should dampen the determination
to press forward to reformation;
and then, sooner or later, the conquest will
be made.</p>

<p>To begin with, when the mind is fully determined
to overcome all obstacles or perish in
the attempt, consult a judicious physician as
advised in the preface of this book. Lose
no time with quackery in any shape or form.
Do not be beguiled by those who promise &ldquo;a
speedy cure.&rdquo; Speedy cures cannot be made
in these cases. Strong determination to
improve aided by proper medication can, in
bad cases, only restore a healthful condition
in from two to three years. The system
requires to be made over anew as it were.
The current of life must be turned into new
channels. New thoughts and new blood must
be made to take the place of what were
wrong and polluted. This will take time
and perseverance; and then, little by little
the old enemies will be overcome and driven
out. But progress for the better must be
measured only from month to month and
even then there may be apparent relapses.
Let me however asseverate, from my abundance
of experience in these cases, that there
is ultimately, after a reasonable time, every
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>hope of becoming sound and healthy again.</p>

<p>Many young persons are rendered quite
distracted by the sexual instinct being too
strong. It infests them and goads them on to
the commission of further unseemly acts&mdash;though
suffering much from past transgressions&mdash;which
it seems almost impossible to avoid.
The sensation haunts and clings to them day
and night, in spite of every attempt to rise
superior thereto. Sometimes nocturnal pollutions,
or &ldquo;wet dreams,&rdquo; as they are commonly
termed, result from these or other causes.
There must be some cause for this state of
things and a rigid examination into one's
mode of life should ascertain the same. It
may come from errors in diet, in eating or
drinking; in the use of highly seasoned food;
or the taking of some medicinal drug substance.
It is well known that many drugs have the
power of producing such a condition. Should
any of the above seem to act as causes, a
change should be made at once. The plainest
diet and simplest mode of life is always
best in sickness or in health. Again, one
may take too little exercise in the open air.
If so, an abundance of physical exertion should
be made daily, to insure a natural and healthy
condition of all organs of the body. Or, uncomfortable
conditions may arise, as they often
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>do, from some morbid condition of the
vital forces. If diet and exercise are insufficient,
the judicious physician should be
consulted and every symptom or unnatural
sensation from the crown of the head to the
soles of the feet, should be carefully described
to him. In all probability he will remedy the
trouble, thus restoring peace and happiness.
The generative organs are as liable to be
affected by a morbid state of the vital forces,
as are any other organs of the body; and
when so affected they are just as amenable to
treatment.</p>

<p>The above condition of affairs is not, however,
confined to the male sex. Females
often suffer equally and in the same way.
Many young persons, of both sexes, have
fallen victims to these disorders who could
have been cured by proper medical treatment.
A female suffering from the ill effects of any
bad habit contracted in youth, or from any
sexual or venereal disorder, should seek
medical aid with the same promptness and
openness of heart as a male. To overcome
the vicious habit of self-abuse is no trifling
matter; it will require the persistent application
of indomitable will, aided by Christianity&mdash;by
oft repeated appeals to the Lord
for aid, who lends a willing ear and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>a helping hand to the poor and needy.
When reformation is determined upon, it is
better to consult a physician at once and act
under his advice. Besides directing the
proper diet and plenty of vigorous exercise
in the open air, he will prescribe the proper
medicament.</p>

<p>Cases of real syphilitic poisoning are most
serious affections, and everyone should know
of the fearful effects of this poison&mdash;how
searchingly it infests the whole system, and
how it contaminates the blood and every
tissue in the body. Such cases, therefore,
should not be trifled with in any way.
Advertised nostrums should be particularly
avoided. For, if this poison be simply
smothered in one's blood instead of being
wholly eradicated and cured, it will be sure
to seize upon the offspring and either destroy
them before birth or during dentition. The
bare fear of such contamination should be
amply sufficient to deter everyone from
exposing <ins title="him&mdash;or herself,">him- or herself</ins> to the risk. But,
having fallen, by all means seek the aid of a
judicious physician. An experience of nearly
forty years in the treatment of these cases, in
both sexes, has given me the power to know
whereof I speak; and I do declare that a
very large percentage of these cases can be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>cured in a safe manner; and so perfectly
cured too, that there will be no danger of
transmitting the infection to the offspring. I,
by no means stand alone in this statement;
many other physicians, after long years of
experience assert the same truth.</p>

<p>Therefore, let no one be discouraged, no
matter how far he, or she, has strayed from
the paths of virtue or how much suffering
has been entailed thereby. In connection
with the physician's help, aid yourself.
Have courage! Let the invincible will lead
on unflinchingly&mdash;upheld by pure thoughts,
and good actions will surely follow. &ldquo;Desire
is really dangerous only when it brings
voluptuous pictures incessantly before the
imagination. It thus holds a thousand conflicts
with virtue which it conquers in the
end; it installs itself in the bosom of the
intelligence of which it becomes the habitual
pre-occupation.&rdquo; Seek therefore for only
pure thoughts.</p>

<p>We should at all times exert all the power
within us to live correct and blameless lives
in every respect, but particularly so in sexual
matters. The happiness, the health, and the
lives of families and communities are far
more largely dependent upon these matters
than is commonly supposed. Those who
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>have led lives of blameless purity, will
continue to do so after reading this book;
while those who have gone astray will here
find every encouragement to set about their
reformation at once. If faithful to the teachings
recorded in these pages they will bless
the day and the occasion that inspired the
writer to put his hand to this work. The
God of Heaven and Earth knows that the
motive that led me to this undertaking
was pure, and as solely for the good of
humanity, as that purity which prompts a
human being to live a blameless life in the
sight of his Maker.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br/><br/>
<small class="non-smcap">ORIGIN OF THE SEX.</small><br/>
<i>From Whence does the Sex Proceed and What
Determines It?</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="cap">So</span> much has been written about this
matter, and so many foolish, low, and
really debasing theories and speculations
have been advanced in relation thereto, that
I deem it expedient at this time, and in this
place, to put forth the true theory of the
reproduction of the sexes, one that can endure
the test of the most rigid scientific investigation.
The only theory upon this subject
worthy of notice, must be based upon a
principle that will hold good and true throughout
all animated nature, not only in the animal,
but in the vegetable kingdom as well.</p>

<p>The earth is the common mother of the
vegetable world; seeds of all kinds fall into
her and she brings forth male and female
plants according to the seeds planted. The
<em>earth</em> certainly does not give the sex to plants
for they come forth according to the life
inherent in the seed; if this life-force be male,
the plant must be male; and if the life-force
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>of the seed be female, the product must be a
female plant. The earth can possibly bring
forth no other sex than that which the life-force
of the seed impels.</p>

<p>This is true in the animal creation. Within
the female grows the seed given her by the
male, be it male or female, and she can grow
none other. In other words the male as is
very evident on mature reflection gives the
soul or the inmost vital principle, and the
female clothes that soul, or gives it a body in
which to operate. What else can the male
do; what office does he perform, if it is not
strictly this: to impart of his life-giving spirit!
The mother in clothing this germ of life
commingles, intertwines, and insinuates her
own spirit, at the same time educating,
instructing, and determining its development
according to the influence she imparts to it.
So the offspring partakes largely of the nature
of both its parents. The determination as to
whether he begets a male or female depends
entirely upon the inmost vital state of the
male at the time of giving, although he is
unconscious of the fact, so that he can have
no choice and no regulation, as some writers
most absurdly claim, in the matter of the
forth-coming sex. He determines or produces
it unconsciously and involuntarily, the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>mother simply receiving, clothing, and issuing
from her body what the father has given her.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten when exploring
these deep subjects that man is a spiritual
being, clothed with a material body, that his
spirit is his inmost, and that what proceeds
from him in the generative act has life from
his inmost; consequently the life-giving
principle of his semen is from his inmost,
which constitutes its life-giving power.
This inmost from the male, the begetting
power, is clothed by his seminal fluid for an
All-wise purpose; it is not the gross material,
the clothing, that begets, but the living power
which this material contains, which fructifies,
or becomes conjoined, or commingled with
the vital force of the ovule of the mother,<a name="FNanchor_K_11" href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>
so that she can clothe it; and when so conjoined
the germ, or seed, is planted in congenial
soil. Conception has thus really taken
place by virtue of this act, and the animal
mother proceeds with her reproduction precisely
upon the same general principles that
mother earth reproduces corn from a single
kernel.</p>

<p>It is universally acknowledged that the
Lord creates, that we owe all to Him, that He
gives us our children, etc., etc. This is true,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>and it is also true that He makes use of the
parents, through whom he operates to this end.
By the constant influx of his Divine Love
and Wisdom He gives us life, and by virtue
of this constant influx into the father who
begets, the mother's conception becomes
doubly sacred. She conceives from her
husband, and at the same instant the Lord
by virtue of His Divine Power breathes into
that conception the breath of life, whereby it
becomes a living soul. By the light of this
truth we see that it is not the parents who
give life to their offspring. They only supply
the pure material substances which are organized
into the human form by the living and
life-giving forces which constantly flow in
from the Lord who is life itself and from whom
all life constantly emanates.</p>
